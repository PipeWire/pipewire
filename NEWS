PipeWire 0.3.2

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- build fixes
- Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
  possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
  and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
  format.
- Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
- Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
  to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
  negotiate.
- Fix JACK midi output.
- Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
  AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
- Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
  shader.
- Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
  processing and use the values from the processing
  context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
- Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
  config file.
- Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
  cause the server to leak all buffers.
- Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
- Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
- Try to select higher quality formats first when
  negotiating a format with an audio device.
- Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
- Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
  do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
  pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
  default and has options to select a different server.
- Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
  samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.


Older versions:

PipeWire 0.3.1

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
  sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
  Only enable this for the jack library for now.
- Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
  signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
  the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
- Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
- improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
  warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
  started the operation or is the owner of the object.
- pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
  in verbose mode
- fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
- Fix and update some examples
- jack: check arguments and don't crash when invalid
- Fix buffer memory upload.
- jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
  install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
  handling.
- fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
- add support for control ports in pw_filter
- fix cleanup of the metadata module
- improve param enumeration.
- Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
- Add create-object command in the config file to create
  object from a factory.
- Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
  nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
- Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
  about a boolean.
- pulseaudio: improve compatibility


PipeWire 0.3.0

The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the developement of
PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
layer with comparable performance to JACK2.

The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
developement files and runtime paths are versioned so that
future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
exising applications.

PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
expected that future version will either switch to a more
flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
configuration options of the example session manager.

PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.

PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
to be somewhat problematic for now.

PipeWire 0.2.97

Eigth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Build fixes
- pw-cat improvement: Fix remote name, add midi support
- add device subscribe params for completeness
- jack and pulseaudio compatibility fixes
- Fix a bug in resampler, add quality option, tweaked quality
  settings, tested now against https://src.infinitewave.ca/
  testsignals and submitted results for publication.
- Fix awkwardness in buffer negotiations, the default number of
  buffers was 4 and jack could only handle 2, causing
  corruption. Also implement negotiation of Step ranges.
- Fix device reservation to work together with pulseaudio,
  previously we would block pulseaudio.

PipeWire 0.2.96

Seventh pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- jack: improve compatibility
- Fix unit test
- Fix license of jack and alsa libs
- Make start/stop more threadsafe
- Fix rt-kit again, add params to configure things, increase default
  soft/hard limits to avoid being killed.
- version 0 compatibility improvements, tested with firefox, cheese,
  GStreamer and chrome using compat layers.
- Fix timing for gstreamer source
- Require libspa in pkg-config file
- Limit buffers to 16 to support old clients

PipeWire 0.2.95

Sixth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Fix tests for big endian some more
- Improve v2 compatibility mode: improve type negotiation and
  update_permissions
- Workaround for firefox screen sharing


PipeWire 0.2.94

Fifth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Fix man page names
- Fix jack set_sync_timeout
- Improve JACK compatibility with apps that cache buffer pointers.

PipeWire 0.2.93

Fourth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Fix unit tests on 32 bits
- Append -pw version to pulse and jack libs. This way we can install
  it next to the real libraries and use a symlink to enable it.

  then also remove the eventfd from the data-loop, making it
  maybe a little faster.
- Fix jack_client_close() compatibility

run correctly in distros.

- Install session manager, fix path to find the session manager
- Fix alsa buffer reuse
- Small fixes for crasher bugs
- Implement pw_core_set_paused() to suspend/resume even
  processing. This can be used when using multiple connections
  to a daemon and one needs to pause one connection until the
  other one completes an action. Used by session managers.
- Improve old version check


PipeWire 0.2.90

This is the first pre-release of the 0.3 version. It consists of a
major rewrite and is not API or ABI compatible with the 0.2
branch.


PipeWire 0.2.7

This is mostly a bugfix release and is API/ABI compatible with
previous 0.2 versions.

Work is ongoing in the work branch that features a completely new
scheduling method that will enable audio support. Some of these
API changes are backported in this branch.

- Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
- deviceprovider: fix probing without starting
- add sentinel to some functions
- compiler fixes for musl
- Revert object tree permission checks that broke things, this is
  probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
  be removed later)

- Improve error checking for threads
- Fix some memory and fd leaks
- Fix compilation with C++ compilers and clang
- DISABLE_RTKIT should now not try to use dbus at all

  sprite with the video stream.
