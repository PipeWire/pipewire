PipeWire 0.2.6

This is mostly a bugfix release and is API/ABI compatible with
previous 0.2 versions.

Work is ongoing in the work branch that features a completely new
scheduling method that will enable audio support. Some of these
API changes are backported in this branch.

- Improve error checking for threads
- Fix some memory and fd leaks
- Fix compilation with C++ compilers and clang
- DISABLE_RTKIT should now not try to use dbus at all
- Camera Portal fixes:
	- add Camera media.role
	- Rename module-flatpak to module-portal
	- Use the portal permissions store for camera checks
- Actually use the passed fd in pipewiresrc
- Make properties with "pipewire." prefix read-only
- Add security label to client object
- Enforce link permissions
- Permissions of objects are now combined with parent permissions
- Remove libv4l2 dependency, it is not used
- Improve format negotiation in autolink #146
- Try to avoid list corruption with event emmission #143
- Fix destroy of client-node memory corruption
- Various small improvements

- Fix crash in loop caused by thread unsafe hook emission
- Add more error checking for thread-loop
- Small cleanups and bugfixes

- Install man pages in right directory
- Add systemd socket activation
- Various memory leak and corruption fixes in properties, dbus and
  buffer mmaped memory.
- Fix v4l2 crash on unplug
- improve stream cleanup
