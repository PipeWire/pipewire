This is the first 1.0 release candidate that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - jackdbus support is now enabled by default.
  - IRQ based scheduling in ALSA was improved and enabled by default for
    Pro-Audio profile. It will also link the pcms together to get lower
    latency. This now matches what JACK does and gives equal latency to
    PipeWire for Pro-Audio profiles.
  - Support both old and new versions of webrtc-audio-processing to make
    the transition easier.
  - Forced quantum changes by nodes or metadata will now also force a
    suspend and resume of the graph, like the rate changes to make sure all
    nodes adapt to the new quantum. This is important for Pro-Audio nodes
    that need to reconfigure the hardware to a new period in IRQ based
    scheduling.
  - Fix a regression in regex parsing.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - jackdbus is by default enabled now. The idea is that when jackdbus is
    installed, the real libjack.so is in the path and we can become a
    real JACK client.
  - Forces quantum changes by nodes or metadata will now also force a
    suspend and resume in the graph, like the rate changes to make sure all
    nodes adapt to the new quantum. This is important for Pro-Audio nodes
    that need to reconfigure the hardware to a new period.
  - The stream now has an EARLY_PROCESS option that can be used to implement
    custum buffer fill levels. (#3480)
  - Fix a regression in regex parsing. (#3528)
  - Fix a bug in position reporting in the driver node. (#3189) (#3544)

    for feedback every 2 seconds to keep some devices alive.
  - A bug in filter-chain was fixed where it would fail to apply the gain
    when mixing just one source.
  - The filter-chain can now pass the stream volume to a control in the
    filter-chain graph. (#3434)
  - Improve volume handling in RAOP sink.

## Pulse-server
  - Some cleanup in the pending_stream handling.
  - Fix a regression in the event emission code where it failed to emit
    a changed event when a node was linked. (#3522)
  - Lower the realtime priority of pulseaudio clients.
  - Set pulse.module.id on the echo-cancel streams. (#3541)

## SPA
  - Support both old and new versions of webrtc-audio-processing to make
    the transition easier.
  - The ALSA driver now does the sync of all followers directly from the
    wakeup event. This results in more stable rate matching.
  - IRQ based scheduling in ALSA was improved and enabled by default for
    Pro-Audio profile. It will also link the pcms together to get lower
    latency. This now matches what JACK does and gives equal latency to
    PipeWire for Pro-Audio profiles.
  - GNU/Hurd support was added.
  - Some improvements to passthrough handling.

## Bluetooth
  - Improvements to the codec handling when PipeWire is used as Audio
    Gateway.
  - Adapt to new Bluez API for BAP devices.

## JACK
  - When the jack library is set in the default library path, avoid using
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH because this can cause confusion.
  - Handle clearing the latency on a port.
  - jack_property now always manages to actually change the metadata because
    it waits for a roundtrip before exiting.

This is a small bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - An old regression was fixed with where some nodes would not run.
  - A regression was fixed where removed events would not be shown in some
    cases. This would result in duplicate entries in audio clients.
  - Fix an off-by-one in the vban audio receiver. Tweak the rate adaption
    a little.
  - ACP will now set a UCM verb before probing the pro-audio devices.
  - More bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - An old regression was fixed with where some nodes would not run. (#3405)

    suspend right when a driver was starting.

## Modules
  - module-rtp-sap does not use the deprecated inet_aton anymore.
  - Fix an off-by-one in the vban audio receiver. Tweak the rate adaption
    a little. (#3380)

## SPA

    for different media-sink instances to avoid encoder resets.
  - Improve enumeration of codec profiles for BAP and A2DP.

## JACK
  - Ensure we can't iterate ports from a deactivated client. Also make sure
    the JACK clients with the node.always-process=false always show their
    ports. (#3416)

## GStreamer
  - A potential crash was fixed in the device provider when stopping.

# PipeWire 0.3.77 (2023-08-04)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a bug in ALSA source where the available number of samples was miscaluclated
    and resulted in xruns in some cases.
  - A new L permission was added to make it possible to force a link between
    nodes even when the nodes can't see eachother.
  - The VBAN module now supports midi send and receive as well.
  - Many cleanups and small fixes.


## PipeWire
  - Global objects now only show permissions that apply to them. The permissions
    required to perform various API calls are documented.
  - A new L permission was added to make it possible to force a link between
    nodes even when the nodes can't see eachother.
  - Config files need to end with .conf.
  - The client.api is added the to global properties of a node.

## modules
  - The VBAN module now supports midi send and receive as well.
  - Fix module-profiler alignment and make sure we don't overrun our buffers with
    many nodes.
  - Protect libcanberra calls with a mutex because it is not thread safe. (#2834)

## SPA
  - Support older compilers for spa_clear_ptr().
  - Fix a bug in ALSA source where the available number of samples was miscaluclated
    and resulted in xruns. (#3395)
  - Don't set inotify on /dev but on the videoX devices directly. Setting inotify
    on /dev would cause a lot of spurious wakeups and lock contention in the
    fsnotify subsystem on some benchmarks.
  - Audioconvert now rate limits the warnings when it runs out of buffers. (#3384)

## pulse-server
  - Some bugs and inconsistencies were fixed in device lookup.
  - Improve subscribe event emission, detect changes to the sink or the monitor
    and send the right sink/source event. (#3388)

    version.
  - JACK clients will now see portregistration from other jack clients when they
    activate/deactivate like real JACK. (#3260)

## bluetooth
  - Use some more autoptr cleanups, fix some leaks.

# PipeWire 0.3.76 (2023-07-28)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a regression that would cause the MPV pipewire backend to fail because
    of a spurious thread-loop signal.
  - Fix a crash when DBus is not found.
  - ALSA hires timestamps are now disabled by default.
  - Some more fixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - A new option was added to pw-thread-loop to signal when the thread starts.
    This is only used in module-rt to avoid regressions in mpv. (#3374)
  - Fix a compilation problem.
  - Stream flags now only set the properties when not already set. This fixes
    a regression with node autoconnect. (#3382)

## Tools
  - pw-cat will now stop when the stream is disconnected. (#2731)
  - Improve the pw-cat man page, mention that stdin/stdout handling is only
    on raw data.

## modules
  - module-rt will now not crash when dbus is not available but error out as
    before.
  - A new VBAN (vb-audio.com) sender and receiver was added. (#3380)

## SPA
  - Add an option in audioconvert to disable volume updates. (#3361)
  - ALSA hires timestamps are disabled by default because many drivers seem to
    give wrong timestamps and cause extra delay.

## bluetooth
  - LE Audio support is now enabled by default when liblc3 is available now that
    bluez has support for detecting the hardware features.

# PipeWire 0.3.75 (2023-07-21)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Link permissions between nodes are now enforced. This avoids potential portal
    managed screencast nodes to link to the camera even though it was not assigned
    permissions to do so by the session manager.
  - Libcamera and v4l2 devices now have properties so that duplicates can be
    filtered out by the session manager.
  - A bug with draining was fixed where a buffer would be marked EMPTY and would not
    play when it contained drained samples. (#3365)
  - Many fixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Permissions for links between nodes are now enforced. The link will now check
    that the owner clients of the nodes can see eachother before allowing the link.
    This avoids screensharing clients to accidentally being linked to the camera
    nodes by the session manager. A side effect is that patchbay tools will no longer
    be able to link portal managed screencast nodes to the camera, for this we need
    a new permission for those patchbay clients. (wireplumber#218)
  - The stream.rules/filter.rules are now evaluated when connecting the stream/filter
    so that more properties can be matched. (#3355)
  - Move some internal events from the context to the nodes to better handle per-node
    threads in the future.
  - The thread-loop will now signal when the thread is started.

## modules
  - A timestamp workaround in module-raop was reverted because it does not work
    in all cases. Instead latency was increased to 1.5 seconds, which also makes
    the problematic device in question work. (#3247)
  - The profiler module was reworked a bit to use the new node realtime events. It
    should now also handle dynamically added and removed drivers.
  - The module-rt now does the rtkit calls from a separate thread so that it does
    not block the main thread. This could cause deadlocks during startup in some
    cases. (#3357)

## SPA
  - Atomic operation macros were move from internal pipewire API to public API.
  - The video-info structure now has a new SPA_VIDEO_FLAG_MODIFIER_FIXATION_REQUIRED
    flag to instruct the application to fixate the modifiers. This simplifies some
    logic in applications a lot.
  - The libcamera and v4l2 nodes now have properties to enumerate the device id
    they are using. This can be used to match v4l2 devices and libcamera devices
    and filter out duplicates.
  - A bug with draining was fixed where a buffer would be marked EMPTY and would not
    play when it contained drained samples. (#3365)

# PipeWire 0.3.74 (2023-07-12)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a critical bug where audio to bluetooth devices would cut out
    randomly. (#3316)
  - Improve RAOP compatibility.
  - Avoid crashes after an update.
  - Small fixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Mix info on port is now created explicitly.
  - Remove the node as a driver peer when stopping. This caused some problem
    with playback on and other remote bluetooth devices. (#3316)
  - Work on avoiding crashes when loading new modules that use internal API
    with old libpipewire. This is typical after an update where the old library is
    still loaded by an application but when a new stream is created, updated
    modules are loaded. (#3243)

## Modules
  - The RTP source module now has an option to ignore the SSRC, which is
    useful to continue to receive the stream when the sender is restarted.
  - The native protocol will refuse to load twice now instead of silently
    ignoring the error.
  - module-raop is compatible with more devices. (#3247)

## SPA
  - plugins will now warn when running out of buffers. This is always a bad
    thing.
  - Merge scope based cleanup macros.
  - Add ratelimit function.

# PipeWire 0.3.73 (2023-07-06)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fixes an ALSA resume after suspend error.
  - Handle and disable seemingly wrong hires timestamps from ALSA.
  - Filter-chain now has loadable plugin modules. The LV2 and sofa plugins are
    moved to a separate .so file to make things more modular.
  - Rate changes in the graph should now be handled more gracefully by loopback
    and filter-chain.
  - A regression in the rtp-sap module was fixed where it would in some cases
    fail to start.
  - A potential crash in the peaks resampler was fixed.
  - Many cleanups and other small bug fixes.


## PipeWire
  - Fix a potential segfault when no fallback driver was set in the config.
  - Improve OPUS detection.
  - Add ASYNC flag to pw-filter and pw-stream when queue/dequeue is not called
    from the process function. This ensure we allocate an extra buffer.
  - Discard pending process callbacks when disconnecting. (#3314)
  - Cleanups and improvements to the debug environment variable parsing.
  - The graph rate was tweaked to better handle very low rates such as those
    requested by pavucontrol when it does the signal monitoring.

## Modules
  - An example filter module was added.
  - Filter-chain and loopback now disable the resamplers if no rate is specified
    and will always follow the graph rate.
  - Improve setup of filter-chain. The graph is now created when starting
    because this ensure the target graph rate is known.
  - Filter-chain can now link notify ports to control ports in the graph.
  - Filter-chain now has loadable plugin modules. The LV2 and sofa plugins are
    moved to a separate .so file.
  - A regression in the rtp-sap module was fixed where it would in some cases
    fail to start.
  - Module-rt now has options to disable rlimits, portal and rtkit.
  - module-raop-discover now has an options to set the latency. (#3247)

## Tools
  - pw-cat now supports overriding all stream properties.

## SPA
  - Disable rate negotiation when the resampler is disabled. We will always
    follow the graph rate. 
  - Set device.icon property for UCM ports as well.
  - Improve ALSA recover when using hires timestamps. This fixes some problems
    after resume from suspend. (#3315)
  - ALSA will now warn and disable hires timestamp when they seem wrong.
    They can also be disabled manually with a property.
  - V4l2 will now gracefully handle ENOTTY when enumerating frame sizes and
    frame rates. (#3325)
  - A potential crash in the peaks resampler was fixed. (#3320)

## pulse-server
  - A client crash in pavucontrol is avoided by always setting a card name.
  - The graph rate is now taken correctly when using the FIX flags. (#3317)
  - An option was added to ignore the FIX flags of a stream. Also the
    documentation for those options was updated. (#3317)
  - module-raop-discover now support latency_msec. (#3247)

## Bluetooth
  - Remove an assert and issue a warning/recover instead when a buffer is too
    small.

## GStreamer
  - The device provider does locking when destroying the registry.

# PipeWire 0.3.72 (2023-06-26)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a critical bug that would refuse to update the samplerate or
    buffersize in JACK clients. (#3226)
  - A new module-netjack2-driver and module-netjack2-manager were added
    that are compatible with NETJACK2. This allows PipeWire to become
    a NETJACK2 manager or a driver between JACK2 or PipeWire servers.
  - Support was added for firewire devices with FFADO. This is untested
    for now and MIDI is not implemented yet.
  - The node scheduling was optimized some more. External drivers are now
    as efficient as in-server ones. This should improve performance of
    various drivers such as bluetooth and JACK based drivers.
  - Many, many bug fixes and a ton of improvements.


## PipeWire
  - pw-filter can now be used to write sinks and sources.
  - The node activation for drivers was changed. The driver now does not
    need to go to the server to start the processing cycle. This makes
    out-of-server drivers as efficient as in-server drivers.
  - Don't try to use drivers with 0 priority as fallback drivers. This
    avoids making the screencast driver a driver for audio. (#3219)
  - Improve xrun count reporting in pw-top and the profiler. Now each
    node has their own xrun counter updated when it fails to complete
    processing during the cycle.
  - pw-filter now also has support for TRIGGER.
  - A potential fd leak was found when fds were send to a zombie client.
    (#1840)
  - Fix a bug where monitor or capture streams were logged twice in the
    profiler. (#3278)
  - Remove stream hooks safely. (#3251)
  - A bug in serialization of container properties was fixed. This could
    result in truncated property values. (#3290)
  - The PIPEWIRE_AUTOCONNECT environment variable now always overrides the
    autoconnect settings of streams. (#3299)
  - Node, port and link destroy now avoids some useless work.
  - Port will now try to renegotiate a new format when idle. (#3266)

## Modules
  - The module-sap now is more compatible with AES67.
  - A new FFADO driver module was added. This is completely untested because
    of lack of hardware. Please test and report issues.
  - A new NETJACK2 driver and a NETJACK2 manager module were added. These
    should be drop in replacements for the JACK2 parts.
  - The RAOP discover module now tries harder to only list devices once.
  - The zeroconf discover module now tries harder to only list devices once.
  - The RAOP sink module now handles latency better and is compatible with
    some more devices. (#3247, #3282)
  - The loopback and filter-chain modules now always dequeue the last input
    buffer to avoid stuttering in some cases. (#3276)
  - The SPA node factory module can now also export nodes. This is used to
    export the PTP clock from the AES67 config file.
  - A bug in module-jack-tunnel was fixed that would cause stuttering and
    corrupted output in some cases. (#3255)
  - The resampler is now disabled in module-loopback and filter-chain when
    the samplerate is set to follow the graph rate. (#2969)
  - The way the mixer peer is sent to clients was improved. It is now also
    possible to let a remote node know about mixer port removes, which
    can avoid memory leaks and some code simplifications.

## SPA
  - Monitor ports now report latency correctly.
  - The ALSA plugin now uses htimestamp to get a more accurate ringbuffer
    position to estimate the clock skew.
  - The channelmixer now has min/max-volume settings to limit or fix the
    volume.
  - The ALSA plugin can now control the playback and capture rate of USB
    gadgets. This can avoid resampling and instead use the USB feedback
    to control the rate.
  - The ALSA output to multiple devices has been improved, some lockups
    are avoided when the device ringbuffer is full.
  - The compress-offload sink has improved negotiation.

## pulse-server
  - Only try to use GSettings when the schema exists.
  - @DEFAULT_SOURCE@, @DEFAULT_SINK@ and @DEFAULT_MONITOR@ are now correctly
    handled as targets in playback and capture streams. (#3284)
  - 2 new quirks are added to disable volume updates on sinks/sources.
    (#1517)
  - The virtual-sink and virtual-source modules were added. These are really
    example modules but actually also work and are useful on PulseAudio so
    implement them as well.
  - Fix initial stream volumes. (#3306)

## Bluetooth
  - Only register A2DP or BAP when we have codecs.
  - Include codec into the media.name

## JACK
  - Fix a critical bug that would refuse to update the samplerate or
    buffersize. (#3226)
  - Improve updates of samplerate/buffersize, delay the updates until the
    client is activated. (#3297)
  - Use the new mix-info updates to simplify the mixer setup and peer
    detection.

## GStreamer
  - Fill default strides instead of 0 on pipewire video buffers. (#3236)

# PipeWire 0.3.71 (2023-05-17)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - A new zero-latency jackdbus bridge was added. This works similar to what
    PulseAudio has to offer and creates a sink/source when jackdbus is
    started. It is however much more efficient and runs the complete PipeWire
    graph as a synchronous JACK client with no added latency.
  - Many performance improvements. Activation of remote nodes is more
    efficient, fewer eventfds are required on the clients, less callback
    overhead in performence critical paths and an optimized poll function
    was added. This was mainly driven by the jackdbus module to get the lowest
    possible overhead when running the graph.
  - The JACK notify callback implementation was reworked to emulate better what
    JACK does, improving compatibility with ardour7 and the JACK stress test.
  - More work on BAP devices. Device latency is now passed on to
    applications also for multi-device headsets, and channel allocation
    is handled better.
  - Many more improvements and bugfixes.


## PipeWire
  - Remove the hardcoded limit on io_areas. This is used to link nodes together
    and exchange buffers, it was limited to 2048 but now dynamically scales
    based on requirements.
  - Rate and quantum changes are now applied correctly in more cases. (#3159)
  - Updates to client-node to more efficiently process the driver.
  - The profiler information was improved to be more accurate. It should
    now work better for remote drivers.
  - Some potential memory map errors were fixed in the protocol because in some
    case with large messages, some fds were closed too soon.
  - pw-filter now implements the pw_filter_set_active() method.
  - A potential out-of-buffers case was fixed in capture pw-streams where buffers
    were not moved to the recycle queue when the node suspended.
  - Nodes are now always woken up with the eventfd. Previously there were
    some optimiztions in the server to directly call into the node process
    function but that optimization is not necessary. Without this optimization
    it is now possible to run nodes in different threads.
  - pw-stream trigger is now implemented correctly in all cases.
  - Remote nodes now use one eventfd less because they get triggered with the
    node eventfd directly.
  - Monitor ports are now ignored in latency updates.
  - A potential race when reporting an error to a client was fixed. (#3192)
  - Fix a bug where always_process nodes would sometimes IDLE. (#3189)
  - Optimize peer activation. Nodes are now activated more efficiently and
    independent of the number of links. It also reduces the number of eventfds
    and memory in remote clients.
  - A bug in property serialization was fixed. Values with spaces would only
    serialize the first part of the value.

## Modules
  - Correctly handle the echo-canceler plugin init method fallback. The
    samplerate was not correctly configured. This is only a regression for people
    that have external echo-canceler plugins.
  - RAOP sink now only sets the volume on the remote end when the stream is
    recording. (#3175)
  - RAOP discover now tries to deduplicate entries from the same host.
  - A new zero-latency jackdbus bridge was added. This works similar to what
    pulseaudio has to offer and creates a sink/source when jackdbus is
    started. It is however much more efficient and runs the complete PipeWire
    graph as a synchronous JACK client.
  - The access module uses a more secure way to check the application
    executable.
  - module-combine-stream now has configurable delay and latency for each
    stream. This can be used to align sinks/sources with different latencies.
  - A potential crash in module-pulse-tunnel was fixed when shutting down.
    (#3199)
  - Module-rt will now clamp the nice value to the min allowed value to avoid
    errors from rtkit. (#3186)
  - Fix a bug with the session counters in module-rtp-sap. Also use the right
    format for L24. Improve the AES67 example config.
  - Improve some warning and info messages in module-rt. (#3194)
  - module-rtp-session should now do something when started without arguments.
  - A potential crash in module-rtp-session was fixed. (#3217)
  - module-filter-chain has better error reporting when a convolver fails to
    load. (#3223)

## SPA
  - Move some things around to avoid compiler warnings. (#3171)
  - Increase mixer ports. Reorganize some things and bump mixer input ports
    from 128 to 512.
  - Fix a potential crash when a node is scheduled before it completes
    the setup.
  - The JACK sink and source SPA plugins have seen some improvements.
  - Allow the peaks resampler still if we disabled resampling.
  - Perform more cleanup in audioadapter when in error.
  - An optimized non-cancellable loop implementation was added.
  - Callbacks were optimized with a _fast() varsion that doesn't check the
    version and method. When this check is performed earlier, it can
    be skipped in performance critical places.
  - Some of the callbacks and system methods are now using the fast function
    calls in critical paths.
  - A potential division by zero was fixed in the ALSA plugins.
  - Improve rate and quantum when starting audioconvert.
  - Make it possible to override node.driver in the SPA null-audio-driver.
    (#3220)

## pulse-server
  - The audio info parameter parsing was refactored and improved.
  - Fix some races with clients exiting when playing samples.
  - An option was added to change or disable the dbus name registration.
    (#2987)

## Bluetooth
  - Implement battery reporting using AT+XEVENT.
  - Disable hardware volume for 3M WorkTunes.
  - Implement BAP audio locations (channel positions) by using the new
    bluez properties.

## JACK
  - Fix some errors reported by JACK test.cpp. (#2638)
  - Add jack.show-midi option to show/hide midi ports.
  - Add jack.max-client-ports option. JACK also has a port limit and so
    PipeWire needs it as well to make the tests happy.
  - Call the shutdown callback only when the server stopped, not when there
    is a random error. (#3070)
  - Avoid registering the same port name twice.
  - Call port registration callbacks in activate/deactivate.
  - Improve jack_port_connected().
  - Improve some error reporting.
  - The JACK headers were updated to a newer version.
  - JACK callbacks are now managed with an event queue to simulate
    more what JACK does. This avoids emiting callbacks when a method is blocking
    for a reply and causing deadlocks. (#3183)
  - Assign unique names to JACK clients. (#2833)
  - Fix a potential crash when the thread_utils was used after free.
  - Aliases are now not filled in by default to improve JACK compatibility.
    (#3154)

# ALSA
  - The ALSA plugin will now wait for negotiation to complete or an error
    before _prepare() completes. This makes more applications deal correctly
    with the potential errors.

# Docs
  - A new document about how scheduling is implemented was added.
  - Update the pw-cli man page. (#2988)
  - Document the SPA Pod serialization.
  - Document the PipeWire native protocol.

# PipeWire 0.3.70 (2023-04-20)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a regression in the scheduler that could keep some nodes IDLE.
  - Fix a regression in the biquad filters in filter-chain.
  - Fix a regression and potential crash in the ALSA mixer probing.
  - Fix a regression in pipewiresrc with timestamps that could cause cheese
    to record video with wrong timestamps.
  - Beamforming support was enabled in the echo-canceler.
  - pulse-tunnel and raop-sink will now proxy local volume changes to the
    remote end.
  - More bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Fix a bug in the graph scheduler where some nodes might stay IDLE in
    some cases (like when connecting the source of the echo-canceler to the
    sink).
  - pw-metadata can now be created from the factory with initial values for
    the metadata. (#3076)
  - Conditions were added to the pipewire config file to make it possible to
    configure the access module and the exec sections.
  - Support was added in pw-stream to intercept and override properties for
    the adapter. This can be used to implement custom volume control, for
    example.

## Tools
  - pw-metadata can now list all available metadata objects with the -l
    option.
  - A new pw-config tool was added to debug configuration file loading and
    parsing.

## Modules
  - The webrtc echo canceler now supports beamforming. You can provide the
    coordinates of the microphones and let webrtc perform beamforming on
    the captured samples to improve quality and remove noise.
  - Fix a regression in the filter-chain with biquad filters. (#3161) and
    improve error reporting.
  - The pulse-tunnel will now proxy the volume changes to the remote end.
  - The RAOP sink will now send volume parameters to control the volume
    remotely. (#2061)

## SPA
  - One ALSA commit was not correctly reverted and might cause crashes.
  - The ALSA sink and source now calculate the ALSA ringbuffer memory
    location more correctly wich might improve compatibility with some
    hardware.
  - v4l2 now sets the values of the controls in the Props param.

## Pulse-server
  - The echo-canceler aec_args are now parsed like they would be under
    pulseaudio.

## Bluetooth
  - More work on synchronizing BAP devices.

## GStreamer
  - The GStreamer source can now renegotiate the format when it changes.
  - The GStreamer source now uses the BaseSrc clocking code to implement
    the clock and timing code.

# PipeWire 0.3.69 (2023-04-13)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Reverted the UCM changes, they seem to cause regressions causing audio
    to be muted in some cases.
  - Fix a regression in the scheduler where a driver node might not be marked
    runnable in some cases, like when echo-cancel is used. (#3145)
  - Handle links from the driver to itself. This makes the midi bridge work
    again. (#3153)
  - ALSA rate matching for sources was fixed. It would previously wait too
    long for rate matching and then cause drift. This should reduce
    crackling and stuttering whan capturing in low latency.
  - Fix the GStreamer clock to make cheese video recording work again. (#3149)
  - More fixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - Fix a regression in the scheduler where a driver node might not be marked
    runnable in some cases, like when echo-cancel is used. (#3145)
  - Handle links from the driver to itself. This makes the midi bridge work
    again. (#3153)
  - Some man pages were improved.
  - Fix a potential crash when thread-loop is destroyed before the loop.
    (#3150)

## Modules
  - A new raw biquad filter was added to filter-chain. You can manually set the
    6 parameters and you can use this to create custom filters per sample rate.
    (#3139)
  - The echo-canceler now supports different channels for the capture and playback
    streams.

## SPA
  - A SB Audigy specific profile set was added to make better use of the
    controls. (#2934)
  - More ALSA IRQ based scheduling improvements.
  - ALSA rate matching for sources was fixed. It would previously wait too
    long for rate matching and then cause drift. This should reduce
    crackling and stuttering whan capturing in low latency.
  - The echo-cancel plugin API has a new method to make it possible to have
    different channels for capture, source and playback.
  - Reverted the UCM changes, they seem to cause regressions causing audio
    to be muted in some cases.

## Bluetooth
  - Many more BAP fixes and improvements. Devices are now created as a set
    and can be combined into one device by the session manager.

## GStreamer
  - Fix the GStreamer clock to make cheese video recording work again. (#3149)

# PipeWire 0.3.68 (2023-04-06)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

This release contains a huge number of changes, some of which might cause
regressions. Please report anything that seems to fail after the upgrade.
UCM devices in particular might have changed names, profiles and ports that
might require changes in custom scripts.

## Highlights
  - Symbolic links to the pipewire binary are now used instead of recompiling
    the same binary multiple times.
  - Changes to the graph scheduler related to quantum/rate updates and
    calculation of the node states. Things should start and switch between
    quantums and rates more smoothly now and especially virtual devices should
    now only run when required.
  - A new RTP session module was added. This uses the Apple MIDI protocol
    to configure low-latency bidirectional MIDI (and with a PipeWire specific
    extension, also audio) between machines. OPUS encoding was added to the
    RTP formats. The SAP module was separated from the rtp-sink/source module
    to make it more usable.
  - A new runtime debug property was added to all streams and nodes to trigger
    a save of the raw samples to a wav file. Support for this has also been
    added to the echo-canceler to debug potential issues.
  - Module pulse-tunnel has improved rate matching and synchronization
    support. It should also not drift anymore for capture devices.
  - The link-factory now ignores by default the link.passive property. This means
    that tools like pw-link or jack clients and wireplumber can't make passive
    links anymore. The reason is that there is now much more advanced logic in
    PipeWire itself to handle passive links based on node and port properties.
  - The RAOP sink was ported to new OpenSSL functions. Digest passwords are
    handled correctly now and support for more devices was added.
  - The ACP code was updated with new PulseAudio UCM code: "Create multiple
    profiles per verb for conflicting devices". This might change the names
    of devices, profiles and ports so scripts might need to be updated.
  - Upmixing is disabled again by default. We now ship config files that
    distros can install to enable upmixing again. The reason being that PipeWire
    should not apply fancy DSP processing to audio by default.
  - Many cleanups and bugfixes, including some crashes and memory corruption
    bugs.

## PipeWire
  - Various FreeBSD compilation fixes.
  - Don't crash when calling _connect twice in stream/filter. (#3091)
  - Links are now installed instead of compiling the pipewire binary
    multiple times.
  - There is now a new core event bound_props that augments the bound_id event
    with the global properties. This can be used to get the global.serial among
    other global properties. It also makes it possible in the future to let the
    server allocate unique names or uuids.
  - Fix a bug where the server could go into an infinite reconfigure loop when
    the samplerate of a driver would change.
  - When a samplerate was forced, restore the previous best samplerate when the
    samplerate is no longer forced. (#2133)
  - Rework how the states of the nodes in the graph are calculated. A more
    refined algorithm is now used that only runs nodes that need to run.
  - Rework how the quantum change is applied to the graph. Drivers are now
    responsible for using the new updated rate/quantum before starting a new
    cycle. This avoids starting a cycle with an old quantum first.
  - pw-stream and pw-filter will now ensure that the Trigger event is called
    from the main thread.
  - node.force-rate=0 will now force the node.rate on the graph, forcefully
    switching the hardware into the new rate if possible. (#3026)
  - Additional checks were added to the thread-loop to check locking order.
  - Additional checks were added to pw-stream and pw-filter to check if methods
    are called from the right thread context.

## modules
  - A new RTP session module was added. This uses the Apple MIDI protocol
    to configure bidirectional MIDI (or audio) between machines.
  - SAP support was removed from module-rtp-source and module-rtp-sink and
    moved to a separate module. This makes it possible to use the RTP modules
    without SAP support as well.
  - The echo-cancel module now has support to save the signals to a wav
    file for debugging purposes.
  - The RTP modules now have support for the OPUS codec.
  - The RAOP module was ported to new openssl encryption functions and handles
    digest passwords correctly now.
  - module-raop-discover now has match rules to be able to select the streams
    and set properties.
  - Module pulse-tunnel has improved rate matching and synchronization
    support. (#3093)
  - Fix potential memory corruption and infinite loops because
    module-pulse-tunnel was unloaded from the wrong thread. 
  - The link-factory now ignores by default the link.passive property. This means
    that tools like pw-link or jack clients and wireplumber can't make passive
    links anymore. The reason is that there is now much more advanced logic in
    PipeWire itself to handle passive links based on node and port properties.
  - module-echo-cancel will now clear its buffers after a suspend to avoid
    playing stray samples.
  - module-raop-sink will now handle 0 timing_port replies. (#3133)

## SPA
  - The adapter module now has support for saving the raw audio to a wav
    file for debugging purposes.
  - The ACP code was updated with new PulseAudio UCM code: "Create multiple
    profiles per verb for conflicting devices". This might change the names
    of devices, profiles and ports so scripts might need to be updated.
  - Upmixing was disabled again by default. We now ship config files that
    distros can install to enable upmixing again. (#3081)
  - audioadapter and audioconvert have seen improvements in the experimental
    non-DSP/passthrough mode.
  - Fix a potential race where the dummy drivers could fail to stop a timer
    and cause endless warnings in the logs.
  - The ALSA plugin has experimental support for IRQ based scheduling. This
    should decrease latency for some (mostly USB) drivers. This should bring
    latency within JACK latency. More work on this will be done before the
    1.0 release later this year.
  - Audioconvert now has support for volume ramping. (#3046)
  - A new loop method was added the check if a thread is currently running the
    loop.
  - channelmix.disable and resample.disable now generate an error when true
    and channelmixing or resampling is required in the converter.

## Bluetooth
  - Fix a crash in some cases when a device was disconnected.
  - Support async transport state changes. This avoids some lockups when the
    bluetooth backend is having issues. (#3023)
  - Align BAP sinks. This improves synchronization between earpieces.

## ALSA
  - Improve properties in pw-top and pavucontrol.

## pulse-server
  - Improve error handling from pulse-tunnel.
  - Generate silence correctly for unsigned formats as well.
  - Review buffer params. The streams should now just work with 1 or 2
    buffers.
  - module-rtp-send and module-rtp-recv now have support for the OPUS codec.

# JACK
  - Make sure we don't call any callbacks anymore when deactivating. (#2781)

## GStreamer
  - Sort the device by priority in deviceprovider. (#3072)

# PipeWire 0.3.67 (2023-03-09)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - The loopback module and other couples streams will now not randomly
    fail in some cases. (#3028)
  - The RTP module now has support for sending and receiving MIDI as
    well.
  - The compress offload sink has seen many improvements. It now uses
    ioctls directly to bypass limitations of tinycompress (to be able
    to detect the available codecs, for example).
  - Pulse server compatibility was improved for some apps by improving
    the format parsing and FIX_ stream flag handling.
  - The min quantum in the pulse server was changed from 256/48000 to
    128/48000 to fix some issues with games that expect 5ms or less of
    latency.
  - The Bluetooth plugin has seen many improvements in packet scheduling
    to attempt to reduce stuttering on some devices.
  - The ALSA plugin now handles some impossible cases better. This fixes
    recording in QEMU again. (#2971)

## PipeWire
  - SPDX tags were added to the code for copyright information.
  - The random number functions were made more usable.
  - The port property code was moved from the adapter to the port
    implementation itself to make it more useful and unified for the
    cases where no adapter is used (midi and video).
  - Fix a potential overflow in mixer areas.
  - Improve runnable state calculations of nodes. This is part of
    ongoing work to avoid running nodes that should not need to run.
  - The stream will now always call the process function when using
    trigger, even if there are no buffers. This avoids stalls of the
    processing graph in some cases. (#3028)
  - Links are now marked as passive by PipeWire itself so that
    the right thing happens in all cases.
  - Implement the in/out/true values for the node.passive property.
    Place a passive state on ports to make passive links on a port
    by port basis.

## Tools
  - pw-cat has seen improvements in the encoded file playback case.

## Modules
  - The rtp module has support for MIDI now.
  - DSCP is now configurable in the RTP module.
  - The loopback module doesn't randomly fail to work anymore. (#3028)

## SPA
  - The null-audio sink can now be given a format and it will return this
    instead of the default float ones. This makes it possible to make a
    null-sink that has a given format.
  - The compress offload sink has seen many improvements. It now no longer
    uses tinycompress to be able to detect the available codecs.
  - The ALSA plugin now handles some impossible cases better. (#2971)
  - Fix compilation on older compilers. (#3050)

## Pulse-server
  - The FIX_ flags are now implemented more correctly by fixating the
    stream to the format of the sink/source they ask to be connected to.
    There is now also an option to override the fixation based on rules.
  - Format parsing was improved and should now support all format strings
    supported by pulseaudio including upper and lower case variants
    and shortcuts.
  - Channelmap parsing was improved and should now reject invalid
    channelmaps as well as support the shortcuts supported by pulseaudio.
  - Escape codes in module arguments now work as it does in pulseaudio. (#3071)
  - The min quantum was changed from 256/48000 to 128/48000 to fix some
    issues with games that expect 5ms or less of latency.

## JACK
  - jack.passive-links can now be used to have a JACK client make passive
    links and the node.passive property is no longer used for this because
    it has a different function.
  - The qsynth rule was updated to the new node.passive features. It is now
    only passive on the output side.

## Bluetooth
  - BAP delay and transport latency are handled now.
  - A2DP and SCO can now use bigger buffers to improve quality when the
    reception is jittery.
  - The AT+BCC command is now implemented.
  - Packet encoding now happens ahead of time when possible to avoid delays
    before sending it.
  - Source should now always produce complete (padded) buffers to avoid sync
    problems.
  - Don't set unnecessary socket options.

## GStreamer
  - The pipewiresrc now has an autoconnect argument.
  - The metadata plane count is now handled correctly in more cases.
  - Stream errors are now handled correctly to stop the GStreamer elements.

# PipeWire 0.3.66 (2023-02-16)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a regression in the pulseaudio module-combine-stream because the new
    module-combine-stream was not installed.
  - PipeWire can now generate a limits.d config file with our recommended
    settings for priorities and memlock.
  - Modules, exec and objects can now be loaded depending on conditions. One
    example is the X11-bell module that can now be disabled with a custom
    property override.
  - Filter-chain has a new mysofa based spacializer plugin.
  - Suport was added for different clocks that allow the RTP modules to work
    with a PTP clock, for example.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Avoid rate switches when the graph is idle.
  - The rate selection algorithm was improved. This ensures minimal performance
    and quality loss when resampling.
  - The default min.quantum was set to 32 again after it got erronously changed
    to (the too low) 16 in version 0.3.45.
  - Fix compilation issues with rust bindings because of macros in defines.
    Work around it for now. (#2952)
  - Invalid file mappings are now refused (#2617 #2914 #3007)
  - Modules, exec and objects can now be loaded depending on conditions. One
    example is the X11-bell module that can now be disabled with a custom
    property override.
  - Filter now also supports _trigger_process() to drive the graph.
  - TID is now added to the journald log.
  - PipeWire generates and installs */etc/security/limits.d/25-pw-rlimits.conf*
    that by default contains project's recommended settings. Creation of the
    pipewire group is left to the distro or user ( `groupadd -r pipewire` ).
    See the rlimits-* Meson options for controlling this behavior.
  - Additionally there is now by default disabled Meson option that will
    install */etc/security/limits.d/20-pw-defaults.conf* with the current Linux
    default memlock value. Distros with only kernels >=5.16 or always using
    systemd v251 or newer do not need this. But all other builds should set the
    `-Dpam-defaults-install=true` Meson option to ensure that the memlock value
    is always large enough. Thanks to Rickie Schroeder for pointing out that
    the default Linux memlock value has been somewhat recently increased.

## modules
  - Install module-combine-stream.
  - RTP source now has support for custom channel names.
  - RTP source will now stop when inactive.
  - Filter-chain has a new mysofa based spacializer plugin.
  - The RTP modules can now use direct clock timestamps to send and receive
    packets. This makes it possible to synchronize sender and receiver with
    a PTP clock, for example.
  - Filter-chain now has an invert plugin to invert the polarity of a
    signal. (#3008)

## SPA
  - There is now an option to set the channels used for probing Pro Audio
    devices. This could unlock more samplerates for some devices when they are
    probed with fewer channels. (#2990)
  - Support was added for other clocks than the MONOTONIC clock in the
    driver nodes. This can be used to synchronize the graph to a PTP clock,
    for example.
  - The ALSA source has some more headroom when rate matching to avoid
    stuttering when following another driver.
  - libcamera controls are now mapped to standard PipeWire property values.
  - The channelmixer has seen some improvements. MONO and undefined channel
    layouts are now upmixed and downmixed more correctly. (#3010)

## Bluetooth
  - Many BAP support fixes.

## GStreamer
  - The gstreamer elements now support buffer video metadata so that strides
    are correctly handled.
  - pipewiresrc will now error out correctly in more cases. (#2935)

## JACK
  - The frame to/from time functions are improved to also work with negative
    time and frame offsets.

# PipeWire 0.3.65 (2023-01-26)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Add back the deprecated symbols but make sure a deprecated warning is
    emitted for them. This fixes compilation issues in bindings.
  - Fix an error in the AVX code that could cause crackling in filter-chain
    when using the mixer.
  - The convolver in filter-chain can now select an IR from a list of IRs
    that best matches the current samplerate. Also resampling of the IR
    has been improved.
  - A new native module-combine-stream was added. You can use this to create
    a 5.1 device from 3 stereo soundcards, for example, or direct the output
    to multiple sinks at once.
  - Support for Bluetooth MIDI was added. This requires a wireplumber
    addition as well.
  - An ALSA plugin rule was added to tweak the buffer settings in Davinci
    Resolve so that it now runs with acceptable latency. (#1697)
  - Support for compress offload was added using tinycompress. This allows
    compressed formats to be decoded in hardware using ALSA on some devices.
  - Many more buffixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Add back the deprecated symbols but make sure a deprecated warning is
    emitted for them. (#2952)
  - Fix a regression when running older servers and newer clients (such as
    flatpaks on older server) where the server would run clients too soon,
    causing crashes. (#2964)
  - Ensure that environment variables override any config values.

## Tools
  - pw-cli has received some improvements in the output.
  - pw-cat can now use ffmpeg to demux streams for compress offload.

## modules
  - The convolver IR volume is now preserved after resampling.
  - Adapter ports can now have a custom prefix.
  - module-rt now clamps the realtime priority to the user allowed one if
    it is within an acceptable range. Before it would fall back to RTKit
    immediately.
  - The module-echo-cancel can now have per stream channel layouts which
    makes it possible to link to specific audio ports on a device. (#2939)
  - Fix an error in the AVX code that could cause crackling in filter-chain
    when using the mixer. (#2965)
  - The convolver in filter-chain can now select an IR from a list of IRs
    that best matches the current sample-rate.
  - module-pipe-* now better matches the pulseaudio properties. (#2973)
  - A new combine-stream module was added to combine multiple sinks into
    one sink. It is also possible to merge multiple sources into one.
  - module-rtp-source now has match rules to select what SAP sessions
    to stream from. There were also improvements to the buffering and
    latency handling.
  - module-rtp-sink now handles multicast loopback correctly.
  - module-rtp-sink implements min-ptime and max-ptime to control the
    send packet latency.

## SPA
  - A new modifier flag was added to the video format parser helper to
    allow 0 (linear) as a valid modifier. (#2943)
  - Params includes were reorganized to make it more scalable. Many compressed
    audio formats were added.
  - The alsa pcm plugin now handles invalid values from the driver
    gracefully. (#2953)
  - Fix some potential stuttering cause by wrong scaling and overflow
    of the output buffers in audioconvert. (#2680)
  - Debug output is now also sent to the log instead of stdout. (#2923)
  - A debug context was added to debug macros to implement custom debug
    handling. This is used to redirect the debug of pods to the debug log
    instead of using some custom duplicated code.
  - Fix some warnings for potentially undefined shifts in format
    conversion.
  - Support for compress offload was added using tinycompress. This is mostly
    used on some embedded hardware where decoding of audio formats can be
    done in hardware.

## Bluetooth
  - Some fixes for LE audio were added.
  - Support for Bluetooth MIDI was added. This requires a wireplumber
    addition as well.
  - Reply OK to empty commands.
  - Improve compatibility with some devices that send stray \n such as
    the Sennheiser HD 350BT. (#2991)

## pulse-server
  - Devices with unsupported formats (by the pulseaudio API) are now also
    listed in the pulseaudio API (with invalid formats).
  - The native module-combine-stream is used for module-combine-sink.

## JACK
  - Make jack.merge-monitor default to true to better match the jack1/2
    behaviour. Add an exception for mixxx, which is more usable with
    unmerged monitors. (#1760)

## ALSA
  - The property handling in the ALSA plugin was improved. alsa.properties
    and alsa.rules can now be added to the config file.
  - A rule was added to tweak the buffer settings in Davinci Resolve so that
    it can run with acceptable latency. (#1697)
  - ALSA volume will now also use cubic volumes, like pulseaudio.
  - The ALSA ctl plugin now also uses the client-rt.conf file.
  - A new alsa.volume-method was added to configure cubic or linear volume.
    This can be set per application using the rules.

## GStreamer
  - pipewiresrc will now advertize DMABUF support if the pipeline suports
    this.
  - pipewiresrc will now always be a live source unless told otherwise.

# PipeWire 0.3.64 (2023-01-12)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Clear old buffer memory on ports to fix some SIGBUS errors.
  - It is now possible to assign custom port names to the ports from an
    adapter. This feature is helpful to those who use a multichannel
    interface with long-term connections. This way they can label each
    port with its designation, such as an instrument name or anything else
    to be displayed in a patchbay or DAW.
  - Fix some issues with node suspend and quantum and rate calculations.
  - Fix some regressions in pulse-tunnel and RTP-source adaptive resampling
    that could cause synchronization problems.
  - UCM devices now also have a Pro Audio profile.
  - NODE_TARGET (with the object.id) is now deprecated, use TARGET_OBJECT
    (with the object.serial, which is not reused and can avoid races).


## PipeWire
  - Clear all peer input port buffers when suspending. This fixes some
    SIGBUS errors when some plugins were using old memory. (#2914)
  - Fix a case where nodes that were not supposed to be suspended, were
    kept suspended on a rate change. (#2929)
  - Fix an error in the quantum and rate calculations that could cause
    nodes to run with wrong quantum and rates when multiple rates were
    allowed. (#2925)

## Tools
  - pw-dump will now sort dictionaries to make it easier to compare
    different outputs.
  - Improve output of pw-reserve.
  - pw-loopback uses TARGET_OBJECT so you will need to use the serial
    id (or better the name) as the target instead of the object id.

## modules
  - The filter-chain modules has seen some cleanups, refactoring and
    optimizations in the various DSP functions.
  - The ROC module now supports setting a custom samplerate.
  - ROC 0.2.X is now required.
  - The pulse tunnel and RTP source were not updating the rate field
    correctly which could cause synchronization problems. (#2891)
  - The filter-chain now supports an arbitrary number of control
    properties. (#2933)
  - It is now possible to assign custom port names to the ports from an
    adapter with the PW_KEY_NODE_CHANNELNAMES.
  - Support was added for capture and playback props in echo-cancel.
    (#2939)

## SPA
  - The ACP code now has an option to set the probe samplerate. (#1599)
  - UCM devices now also have a Pro Audio profile.
  - Filtering of Step ranges is now implemented.

## Pulse-Server
  - The channel-map is now set correctly on the echo-cancel module.
  - source_master and sink_master are now correctly handled in module
    echo-cancel.
  - Fix a regression in DRAIN where resuming after a DRAIN would fail.
    This caused problems for espeak. (#2928)
  - TARGET_OBJECT is now used to make it possible to use the indexes
    as a target.
  - ladspa-source and remap-source can now also link to monitors.

## ALSA
  - The ALSA plugin now handles the target.object correctly when set to
    -1. (#2893)

## V4L2
  - The v4l2 replacement library now also follows symlinks.
  - Support for getting and setting controls was added.
  - Support for G_PARM was added.
  - The environment variable PIPEWIRE_V4L2_TARGET can be used to force
    an application onto a specific camera.

## Bluetooth
  - Fix compilation without ldac_abr.
  - Fix a missing brace in CIND reply. This could cause some devices to
    fail.
  - Fix configuration of the initial latency.

## GStreamer
  - The device provider now supports setting an fd so that it can connect
    to PipeWire sessions from the portal.
  - DMABuf support was re-enabled in gstpipewiresrc.

# PipeWire 0.3.63 (2022-12-15)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a critical bug that causes audio distortion in some cases when using
    AVX2.
  - Fix a crash in mpv caused by deinit of PipeWire.
  - Resample the convolver IR to match the graph samplerate for better
    results.
  - Many more small bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Fix a segfault in the PipeWire deinit code triggered by mpv in some
    cases. (#2881)
  - Fix docs about SPA_PLUGIN_DIR.
  - Always dlclose by default (even under valgrind). Add an option with
    PIPEWIRE_DLCLOSE to select alternative behaviour.
  - Improve PIPEWIRE_DEBUG category handling.

## modules
  - Resample the IR for the convolver when the IR samplerate and graph rate
    don't match.

## SPA
  - Handle spurious reads from timerfd gracefully.

# PipeWire 0.3.62 (2022-12-09)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - A regression in screensharing was fixed. It was caused by a race when
    activating links and driver nodes.
  - Video transform metadata was added so that cameras and screen sharing
    can report the video orientation and transformations.
  - Support for the PulseAudio module-gsettings was added to make paprefs
    work.
  - Support for bluetooth offloading was added. This allows for the bluetooth
    reception, decoding and playback to happen completely in hardware.
    This also requires some support in WirePlumber.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - More work on stopping nodes in a more controlled way.
  - Fix a race in starting nodes and drivers. In some cases the driver
    node would already be started while the link to the peer node was not
    ready yet. This caused regressions in screen sharing. The driver is
    now only started after all the followers and links completed.
  - Fix a case where a slow capture stream would not recycle buffers
    anymore and stall. (#2874)
  - Fix a subtle bug in pw_loop_invoke that could cause callbacks to be
    delayed and cause crashes in some cases.
  - Fix a case where IPC was done from the data-thread and could cause
    crashes.

## Tools
  - Silence some expected errors in the pw-top output.

## modules
  - The filter-chain has seen some optimizations in the copy plugin and
    the convolver.
  - The zeroconf plugin will now only unpublish services from the server
    that was removed.

    that could cause segfaults. (#2633)

## SPA
  - There is now a video transform metadata that indicates how a video
    frame was transformed (rotated/flipped). libcamera and the GStreamer
    elements now have support for this metadata.
  - The SPA volume plugin is now disabled from the default build.
  - Handle missing control info in libcamera.
  - Handle errors from loop better, don't call the callbacks on errors.
  - Somewhat improve performance in some audioconvert AVX2 code for format
    conversion.
  - Fix PortConfig and EnumPortConfig params in audioconvert and
    audioadapter to reflect what is actually going on instead of using
    hardcoded values.
  - Pass ignore-dB property correctly in all cases.
  - Probing is now done in 48KHz again. (#2857)

## Pulse-server
  - IPv4 addresses are now added first to the list and exposed first with
    zeroconf discover.
  - module-gsettings was added to make paprefs work.
  - The pulse.idle.timeout option was disabled by default and only enabled
    for selected apps (speech-dispatcher) because it caused some problems
    for other apps. (#2880)

## JACK
  - Only process valid ports. Could fix some crashes. (#2863)

## Bluetooth
  - Support was added for offloading bluetooth handling. Some hardware can
    receive, decode and play the bluetooth audio directly in hardware.

    play and some events would be missing.
  - The network module now doesn't export other network sources
    anymore.
  - pulse-server now detects clients that keep underrunning for a long time
    and will pause them to save power.
  - Many more bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Optimize away some useless graph recalculations.
  - Increase alternative sample rates from 16 to 32.
  - FreeBSD and musl build fixes.
  - Silence some module loading errors when the error can be ignored.
  - Fix initial buffer requested size for pw-stream when operating in
    async mode. This also indirectly fixes the first buffer in
    pw-midiplay. (#2843)

    a port reconfiguration, leading to crashes, especially when
    automatically switching profiles in bluetooth. (#2764)
  - Do ALSA probing in 44100Hz again. Some devices seem to fail
    otherwise for some unknown reason. (#2718)
  - Force playback start when the ALSA buffer is full. This fixes sound
    in QEMU. (#2830)
  - Support Digital 5.1 AC3 for Asus Xonar SE.

    plugin work again for deadbeef. (#2832)
  - Fix latency reporting on adapter DSP ports.

## pulse-server
  - Fix a bug where openal based applications would hang. (#2821)
  - Improve zeroconf publish. Only publish on the address of the first
    running server. This avoids duplicate entries for IPv4 and IPv6.
    Add support for republish entries when new servers are started.
  - Add a pulse.idle.timeout option (default to 5 seconds) to pause
    streams that have been underrunning for this amount of time. Badly
    behaving clients will then not keep the graph and device busy so
    that devices can be suspended to save battery. This should give
    better default behaviour with speech-dispatcher. (#2839)

## JACK
  - Add an option to configure the filter character.
  - Fix connect_callbacks. It was only called once for output ports.
    (#2841)

    to announce and consume RTP streams and is compatible with the
    PulseAudio RTP modules.
  - Many small bluetooth improvements and fixes.
  - The alsa plugin will now only start playback when there is data. This
    results in better sync and lower latency between capture and playback.

    requested one (instead of picking the default).

## Modules
  - Fix some crashes in filter-chain. (#2737)
  - X11 Bell module will now be loaded by default when available.
  - A new RTP module was added with a sender and receiver. It uses SAP
    to announce and consume RTP streams and is compatible with the
    PulseAudio RTP modules.

  - The echo-cancel module now uses the resampler prefill option to align
    input and output samples without buffering. Better latency control
    when starting and stopping has been implemented.

    when the ringbuffer wraps around. This fixes playback issues with
    multichannel sinks.
  - Add a delay option to module-loopback using a ringbuffer.
  - Implement echo-cancel params.
  - The filter-chain module has better error reporting.

    them. This avoids stalling the graph.
  - libcamera now suggests a more appropriate frame size than the smallest
    poster frame.
  - Improve state changes in audioconvert. (#2764)
  - A new seq field was added to spa_param_info to keep track of pending

    state.
  - Fix jack_client_thread_id() to return NULL when the client is not active,
    just like jack1 and jack2.
  - An option was added to let the jack_set_buffer_size() function update the
    global metadata. A quirk was added so that jack_bufsize uses this new feature
    to make the buffer size settings persistent and global, just like jack.
  - jack_port_register() and jack_port_unregister() can be called on an
    active client so make this thread safe. (#2652)

  - Start suggesting to use target.object instead of node.target in docs
    and examples.

## SPA
  - Use the cosh window again for the resampler. It should now
    give better resampler quality. (#2483)

    multiple times, causing strange artifacts when upmixing.
  - Be more strict about valid JSON floats.
  - device.vendor.id and device.product.id should now always show up in
    0xXXXX format and should not be converted to floats in pw-dump anymore.
  - Add triangular dither, add unit tests for noise generation, add some
    more optimizations.

## Bluetooth
  - HFP and A2DP now expose different routes and thus can have different
    volumes.
  - HW Volumes for HFP are now synced better. Volume changes from HW buttons
    are now also saved.

# PipeWire 0.3.54 (2022-07-07)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Some critical bugs in the new audioconvert were fixed. The old
    adapter had internal buffering that was abused in some places.
  - The bluetooth sources were rewritten using a ringbuffer to make them
    more reliable to jitter and remove old audioconvert behaviour.
  - Many improvements to the audio converter.
  - Native DSD128 and up is now supported by pw-dsdplay.


## tools
  - Support DSD128 to DSD512 as well by scaling the amount of samples
    to read per time slice.

## SPA
  - Format conversion is now generated with macros to remove duplication
    of code.
  - 24bits conversions were rewritten to use the generic conversion
    functions.
  - Temporary buffers in audioconvert are now made large enough in all
    cases.
  - Fix draining in audioconvert. This fixes speaker-test.
  - Fix the channel remapping. (#2502, #2490)
  - Audio conversion constants were tweaked to handle the maximum ranges
    and provide lossless conversion between 24bits and floats.
  - Vector code and C code are aligned and the unit tests are activated
    again. A new lossless conversion test was added.
  - Fix an underrun case where the adapter would not ask for more data.
  - Fix PROP_INFO for audioconvert. (#2488)
  - Use the blackman window again for the resampler, the cosh window has
    some bugs that can cause distortion in some cases. (#2483)
  - Add more unit tests for audioconvert. Add end-to-end conversion tests.
  - Don't leak memory in format converter.

## pulse-server
  - Card properties are now also added to sinks and sources, just like
    in pulseaudio.
  - Increase the maxlength size to at least 4 times the fragsize to avoid
    xruns.
  - Fix a race when setting default devices.

## Bluetooth
  - The source was rewritten to use a ringbuffer. This avoids regressions
    caused by audioconvert. 

# PipeWire 0.3.53 (2022-06-30)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - The 44.1KHz samplerate was removed again from the defaults, it caused
    all kinds of problems with various hardware.
  - The ALSA plugin should now be able to deal with unsupported samplerates
    and fall back to the nearest supported one.
  - The rlimits performance tuning wiki page was updated. Please check
    you limits.conf file, the version on the wiki used to give all
    processes a -19 nice level instead of just the pipewire daemon.
  - The audioconvert plugin was rewritten to be more maintainable and
    faster. It also gained support for control ports and dithering with
    optional noise shaping.
  - An impossible buffering situation is avoided in pulse-server that would
    cause some applications (sunshine, ...) to stutter.


## PipeWire
  - 44.1KHz was removed from the allowed rates again. It caused all kinds
    of regressions due to driver bugs and timing issues on HDMI.

## modules
  - filter-chain now does some more error checking and reporting to
    avoid some crashes.
  - filter-chain now supports more channel layouts for input and output
    that does not need to match the plugin layout.
  - Format parsing is now more consistent in the modules.

## Tools
  - pw-cli can now also work without readline support.
  - pw-cat can now also read multichannel ulaw/alaw/u8/s8.

## SPA
  - The audioconvert plugin was rewritten. This should make it more
    maintainable. It also fixed some issues such as CPU spikes in some
    cases and crashes in others. The old plugins were removed, for a
    code reduction of some 6000 lines.
  - The audioconvert plugin now supports control ports, which can be
    enabled on nodes in the session manager. This makes it possible to
    control audioconvert properties using timed events or midi.
  - NoteOn 0-velocity MIDI events are no longer filtered out. This is
    a valid event, nodes that can't deal with it should fix it up
    themselves. The JACK layer still filters out these events by default
    but this can now be configured with a per-client property.
  - The running status on midi events is now disabled to match what
    JACK does.
  - The ALSA plugin will now deal with driver bugs when a driver announces
    support for a samplerate but then refuses to use it later.
  - The ALSA plugin has been optimized a little for sample IO.
  - V4L2 now doesn't error when there are no controls.
  - Error handling was improved in the audio converter.
  - The audioconvert plugin now supports rectangular dithering and
    noise shaping.
  - The audioconvert plugin can now insert additional inaudible noise
    that can be used to keep some amplifiers alive. (#705)
  - The audioconvert format conversion was changed so that it now produces
    the full 32 bits range in the C fallback conversion code as well.
  - The resampler window function was changed to a cosh() window
    function. (#2483)
  - Vendor and device id are now in hex.

## pulse-server
  - Tweak the record buffer attributes some more and make sure we don't
    end up in impossible buffering situations. Fixes an issue with
    distorted sound in sunshine. (#2447)
  - Fix a potential crash when updating the client property list.
  - Some properties on cards were aligned with pulseaudio.

## Wiki
  - Change "priority" to "nice" in the example limits.conf file. It was
    giving a -19 nice level to all processes, not just the pipewire
    daemon.

# PipeWire 0.3.52 (2022-06-09)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

  - Add -n option to pw-loopback to set node names.
  - Add -P option to pw-cat to pass properties to the stream.
  - Support stdin/stdout in pw-cat. (#2387)
  - pw-dump now also dumps object removal when monitoring. (#2426)

## SPA
  - Avoid duplicate param results in pw-dump for ports.
  - Avoid endless loops in audioconvert for badly behaving client.
    (#2359)
  - Scale max-error in alsa based on quantum and avoid logging a warning
    when starting.

  - Improve ALSA resync behaviour. (#2257)
  - Add support for Komplete Audio 6 MK2.
  - Improve loop cancel while iterating.
  - Try not to mix surround channels and AUX channels. Make card with many
    ports look better when not using the Pro Audio profile.
  - Vulkan filters were added.

## Bluetooth
  - Add LC3plus vendor codec.
  - Handle unsupported indicators better.
  - Ensure multiple devices on an adapter use different codecs because one
    endpoint can only be used by one device at a time.
  - Fix bitpool control as a follower.
  - Handle bluetooth errors better.
  - Speed up bluetooth connection by only waiting for the profiles
    supported by the adapter.
  - The dummy AVRCP player is disabled by default because it seems to break
    more devices than it fixes.

## pulse-server
  - Add initial stream latency property so that devices can be started
    with a resonably accurate latency.
  - Fix ringbuffer underrun case. (#2366)
  - module-native-protocol-tcp now has a auth-anonymous option to give

    as still loaded.

## ALSA
  - Add support for updating sw_params at runtime, mostly the min-avail
    param.
  - Capture and playback nodes are now assumed to use a different clock and
    will activate the adaptive resampler when linked. This assumption is
    removed in Pro Audio mode. This provide a better experience out of the
    box with most devices.

## JACK
  - Fix setting properties with PIPEWIRE_PROPS again.
  - Don't use 64 bits atomic operations for sync_timeout. (#1867)
  - Cleanup in error cases was improved, avoiding some crashes. (#2394)

# PipeWire 0.3.51 (2022-04-28)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Improved graph reconfiguration.
  - Extra configuration options for streams and filters with config
    rules and environment variable.
  - Improve module-pulse-tunnel latency, stability and error recovery.
  - pw-top, pw-cli and pw-link improvements.
  - Fix a channelmixer upmixing clipping issue.
  - The ROC module has seen many improvements.
  - Many more bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - The graph reconfiguration code was reworked:
    * Moved nodes will update the new driver quantum correctly. (#2293)
    * Inactive nodes are ignored more.
    * Nodes that require a driver are now not scheduled anymore when
      they are passive (unused). (#2309)
    * Improved performance, the graph is reconfigured with a minimal
      amount of changes.
  - Method and event argument names were improved.
  - A linker garbage collection problem was fixed. (#2292)
  - Properties on threads are now implemented. Use common code to
    set thread name and add an option to set stack-size.
  - Streams and filters always want a driver now. This makes it possible
    to just link a playback stream to a capture stream without a driver
    and have it work. (#1761).
  - Streams and filters can now also have rules in the config file.
  - Streams, filters, JACK, ALSA and v4l2 now support PIPEWIRE_PROPS
    environment variable to override node properties.
  - Add config section extensions. This provides a way for modules to
    have specific config to override the default config.
  - Handle realloc errors better.
  - Improve stream and filter property updates.

## Modules
  - The pulse-tunnel modules has improved latency management and should
    now work a lot better. (#2230)
  - Module-loopback, module-echo-cancel, module-filter-chain unload the
    module when a stream is destroyed. (#1754)
  - Biquads in filter-chain now can have more gain (5->20 dB).
  - Documentation updates. Most Wiki content was moved to the source code
    inline comments.
  - Filter-chain now has a builtin delay line filter. (#2320)
  - Filter-chain can now parse the config key correctly in all cases.
  - The ROC sink and source saw many improvements. roc-source is now a stream
    by default that connects to the default sink. Both modules will try to set
    a graph rate. Both modules have an option to select the FEC mode.
    The ROC source has lower latency now. (#2331)
  - Handle realloc errors better.

## tools
  - pw-cat does not have --list-targets anymore, use one of the more
    advanced and less buggy tools such as wpctl or pw-cli to list
    sinks and sources.
  - pw-top has seen many improvements.
    * It now has some timeouts to reset the node values to their default
      state when unused.
    * The man page was improved.
    * Invalid timings and errors are displayed in a better way.
  - pw-cli and pw-link can now create links between all ports of given nodes.
  - pw-cat can now save to other file formats than wav, based on the extension
    of the filename.

## SPA
  - The resampler now uses a different internal method for draining. It can
    now also handle 0 size buffers as input without draining.
  - The channelmixer now uses the front channel averages for FC and LFE.
    This avoids clipping and results in much better upmixing.
  - ALSA should now work again on 32 bits. (#2271)
  - The JSON parser now converts escaped unicode correctly to UTF8.

## bluetooth
  - Codec switch improvements when the device is disconnected. (#2334)

## pulse-server
  - There is a new module-roc-sink-input module, the the PulseAudio equivalent.
  - The ROC source and sink-input module now have a much lower latency.
  - The ROC module now has an option to select FEC mode.
  - Playback and record rate adjustements should work now. (#1159)

## JACK
  - Remove some useless pthread attributes. This makes JACK work in QEMU with
    sandboxing enabled. (#2297)
  - The buffer_size callback is now only called when something has changed
    since the last process() callback or get_buffer_size() method. This
    fixes a GStreamer issue and is more in line with what JACK does. (#2324)
  - Fix a potential deadlock when the process thread is doing IPC and the
    IPC thread is blocking on the data thread.
  - Allocation errors in metadata are handled better.

# PipeWire 0.3.50 (2022-04-13)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - pw-stream can now report more timing information and can suggest
    the optimal number of samples to queue for playback.
  - pw-dot now works again..
  - module-pulse-tunnel latency was improved.
  - WINE applications using the JACK backend should no longer crash.
  - The channelmixer defaults are improved and the muffled sound when
    playing back 5.1 and 7.1 material has been fixed.
  - Many fixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - pw-stream now places a suggested amount of samples in the pw-buffer
    for playback. This allows you to remove some places where
    spa_io_rate_match was needed to get this information.
  - pw-stream has new API to request a timing update. New fields are
    added in the timing info, such as number of buffered samples in
    the resampler and the number of queued and dequeued buffers.
  - pw-stream has support for double controls now. More controls are
    exposed such as the Rate control to do adaptive resampling.
  - The thread-utils object was moved to the context to avoid some
    concurrent use cases that caused crashes. (#2252)
  - Deactivating an exported node/stream will now remove the node from
    the data-thread immediately so that the process function will not
    be called anymore and resources can be safely freed. This could
    fix some of the last remaining crashes when streams are stopped.
  - PipeWire will now fail to load a module that tries to register
    the same export type twice instead of silently doing the wrong
    thing. (#2281)

## Modules
  - Many modules now use the NODE_WANT_DRIVER instead of the
    pipewire.dummy NODE_GROUP property. This makes it possible to use
    them with any other driver and can avoid resampling in some
    cases.
  - module-pulse-tunnel now uses an adaptive resampler to keep the
    latency under control. Latency should be much better than before
    and stay constant even when there are network delays.
  - There is now an option for packages to disable building the RTKit
    module, which is still built by default for backwards compatibility
    reasons.
  - A leak was fixed in filter-chain. (#2220)
  - Module node names are now made more unique with the pid.

## tools
  - pw-cat verbose output has been improved.
  - pw-link now has a man page. (#2263)
  - pw-reserve now has an -r option to make it issue a RequestRelease
    command on the owner of the device. This makes it possible to ask
    WirePlumber to close and release a device.
  - Fix pw-dot again. It didn't work anymore because of stray done
    events that were emitted to notify the client of object serials.
    (#2253)

## SPA
  - The channelmixer now has PSD upmixing enabled again. We used the
    simple upmixing in the previous release but that just sounds too
    aweful to be a good default. (#861) and (#2219)
  - The channelmixer will not upmix FC and LFE anymore when upmixing is
    explicitly disabled. (#2266)
  - The channelmixer will only lowpass filter FC and LFE channels when
    they were upmixed. (#2280)
  - The defaults of the channelmixer were tweaked a little. There is now
    a little bit more bass in the LFE channel and more high fequencies
    in the FC channel when upmixing. Also the channel widening has been
    disabled by default.
  - Locale independent float parsing now uses a more portable solution
    with uselocale.
  - ALSA will now only allocate a buffer size big enough to hold 4
    times the quantum limit instead of as large as possible.

## pulse-server
  - Internal cleanups in handling of modules.
  - A quirk to force s16 sample formats for teams-insider has been added.

## JACK
  - The data-loop is now started in activate and stopped in deactivate.
    This makes the data-loop respect any custom thread functions you
    configure. This also makes WINE apps using the JACK backend work.
    (#1495).
  - Port sorting was improved/fixed. (#2260)

# PipeWire 0.3.49 (2022-03-29)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Sample rate switching should work again.
  - pw-dot can now use the output of pw-dump to render a graph.
  - Bluetooth A2DP streaming was improved that would reduce stuttering on
    some devices.
  - A JACK bug was fixed that would sometimes make it impossible to add more
    tracks in Ardour. (#1714)
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - Fix a potential crash when NULL params were configured.
  - Add some simple functional tests to avoid some recent regressions. Improve
    the test framework for this as well.
  - Improvements to the poll loop to avoid some use-after-free scenarios.
  - Fix samplerate switching again.
  - setlocale is not called anymore from the pipewire library. This should be
    called by the application. (#2223)
  - pw_init() and pw_deinit() can now be nested and called multiple times.
  - pw_stream will now report the resampler delay in the pw_time.queued field.

## modules
  - module-filter-chain now supports arbitrary many properties and will use
    property hints to assign them the right type.
  - The ROC modules now accept a sink/source_properties parameter.
  - The module-rt can now also be built without RT-Kit support.
  - module-echo-cancel can now use a fraction to specify the delay for more
    precise control.

## SPA
  - The channelmixer will now do upmixing by default and will not use
    normalization. It will also use a simple upmixing algorithm that duplicates
    channels by default. A more interesting upmix method is also available (PSD)
    but needs to be enabled manually. (#861)
  - Add SSE optimized (de)interleave functions for 32 bits samples with and
    without byteswap.
  - JSON parsing of empty strings will now give an invalid number instead of
    0.
  - JSON numbers are now parsed and serialized in a locale independent way so
    that , and . are not mixed up.
  - The resampler will now report the resample delay and queued samples as the
    extra delay.

## tools
  - pw-cat will read more dsf files correctly and will not crash at the end.
  - pw-top now has a man page.
  - pw-dot can now use the output of pw-dump to render a graph.

## bluetooth
  - Improve interactions with oFono.
  - Fix recovery with slow connections.
  - Improve frame size of AptX-ll.
  - A2DP can now use any quantum and will flush packets in smaller chunks
    when needed to adapt. This improves stuttering in some cases.

## pulse-server
  - The server configuration can now be placed in pulse.properties section,
    which also makes it possible to have custom overrides.
  - Implement FIX_ flags for capture as well.
  - Small fixes and improvements in module loading.

## JACK
  - Clear the last error before executing a new action or else we could end up
    with error from a previous action. This causes some problems in Ardour where
    adding a track would fail after some time. (#1714)


# PipeWire 0.3.48 (2022-03-03)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix IEC958 passthrough again.
  - Fix pulse-server crashes when playing a sample.
  - Support for more a more advanced upmixing algorithm.
  - filter-chain now supports arbitrary many ports.
  - Fix multichannel support in WINE. (with new WirePlumber).
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - The work queue is now created in the context so we can fail early and
    avoid further error checking in various places.
  - Fix a potential use after free with threaded loops.
  - The protocol now has a message footer. This is used to pass around
    global state such as the last registered object serial number. This can
    be used to detect when a client tries to bind to old (but reused)
    object ids. This avoids some races in the session manager but also
    when binding objects.
  - The zero-denormals CPU flag is now not touched anymore unless explicitly
    selected by the user. Denormals are avoided in filter-chain now in
    software. If the zero-denormals are now only configured in the data
    thread. This should fix issues with luajit. (#2160)
  - Configuration parsing will not actually fail on errors.
  - pw-top now correctly clips unicode characters.
  - Many places now use a dynamic POD builder to support arbitrary large
    property sets.
  - pw-stream now support PropInfo parameters so that they can announce
    custom properties.
  - Serial number are now also set on metadata and session-manager objects.

## SPA
  - audioadapter is now smarter when trying to fixate the format. It will
    use the PortConfig format to fill in any wildcards. This results in
    the least amount of conversions when the stream can handle it. It also
    is part of a fix (also requires a session manager fix) for WINE
    multichannel support. (#876).
  - Fix 5.1 to 2 channels mixing. It was using the volume of the stereo
    pair on all channels.
  - Fix some weird volume issues when a source is capturing and
    channelmixing.
  - Add stereo to 7.1 upmixing.
  - The channelmix parameters can be changed at runtime now.
  - Many improvements to the upmixing algorithms. Rear channels are now
    constructed from the ambient sound and can have delay and phase shift
    applied to them to improve spacialization. The stereo channels can
    be filtered so that the dialog is more concentrated in the center
    channel. (#861)

## modules
  - Module X11 bell received cleanups and improvements.
  - The module now has a private method to schedule unload later. This
    simplifies cleanup in many modules.
  - module-filter-chain now handles arbitrary many ports and control
    ports. (#2179)
  - Fix a bug in RAOP where it was reading from the wrong port. (#2183)

## pulse-server
  - Nodes with the DONT_MOVE property should fail with -EINVAL when
    they are moved.
  - Fix a segfault when playing a sample. (#2151)
  - The _FIX flags in pulse-server also now ignore the configured
    sample format, just like pulseaudio does. (#876)
  - Fix IEC958 passthrough again. It got accidentally broken since
    0.3.45 with a fix for another issue. (#1442)
  - Fix module-null-sink device.description. (#2166)

## Bluetooth
  - Don't try to connect HSP/HFP when no backend is available.


# PipeWire 0.3.47 (2022-02-18)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

This is a quick emergency release to fix some severe
problems with the previous release.

## Highlights
  - Fixes a bug in pulse-server that caused cached notifications
    to play multiple times. (#2142)
  - Removed check and warnings to catch leaked listeners on the
    proxy. This might access invalid memory and cause infinite
    loops in older wireplumber.

# PipeWire 0.3.46 (2022-02-17)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a critical bug in pipewire-pulse buffer size handling that made some
    apps (MuseScore, ... ) stutter.
  - Fix a critical bug where devices would not show when the kernel was
    compiled without VERBOSE_PROCSFS.
  - JACK clients will now use lock-quantum by default. This makes sure that
    all dynamic quantum changes are disabled while a JACK app is running.
    The only way to force a quantum chance is through a JACK app or with
    the metadata.
  - Almost all limits on number of ports, clients and nodes are removed.
  - A Dummy fallback sink is now automatically created when there are no
    other sinks. This avoids stalling browsers.
  - Sound sharing with Zoom should work better. A new WirePlumber release
    might be required.
  - Many more fixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Update docs with new config overrides.
  - The rule matching logic was moved to config and code is now shared with
    pulse-server and JACK.
  - Add new Romanian translation.
  - When a quantum is forced with metadata, any node that asked to lock-quantum
    is ignored so that the quantum change can happen.
  - Fix a bug where a mixer was removed twice, leading to potential memory
    corruption.
  - The port limits on nodes and filters are now removed. Some code was
    simplified.
  - Fix a potential leak because listeners where removed while they could be
    emitted.
  - Improve context.exec and avoid zombie processes.

## Modules
  - The RAOP module now has a default latency of 2 seconds, like PulseAudio.
  - The echo-cancel module now uses the plugin loader to load the backends.
    This makes it possible to add custom, out of tree, echo cancel plugins.

## Tools
  - Improve help of pw-link.
  - Output to stdout and error to stderr. Use setlinebuf for stdout to improve
    piping between apps. (#2110)

## SPA
  - Improve removing sources when dispatching. Also improve performance now
    that a destroy loop can be removed. (#2114)
  - Fix an fd leak in the logger when logging to a file.
  - Improve loop enter/leave checks and support recursive loops.

## pulse-server
  - Clamp various buffer attributes to the max length. Fixes some issues
    with various applications. (#2100)
  - Module properties are now remapped correctly from their pulseaudio variant
    to the PipeWire ones.
  - Fix module index in introspect. Use the right index when loaded from our
    internal modules. (#2101)
  - Improve argument parsing and node.description. (#2086)
  - The sink-index should now be filled in correctly when playing a sample.
    (#2129)
  - module-always-sink is now implemented and loaded by default. (#1838)

    like in PulseAudio. This improves sounds sharing in Zoom.

## ALSA
  - Fix critial bug where alsa devices would not show when the kernel was
    compiled without VERBOSE_PROCFS.
  - Some corner cases were fixed in the ALSA timing code. When the capture node
    is follower, it will now not try to read too much data and xrun but it will
    instead produce a cycle of silence.
  - Various fixes and improvements to make ALSA devices resync to the driver
    more quickly and accurately.

## JACK
  - Add an option to name the defauld device as `system` to improve
    compatibility with some applications,
  - Use lock-quantum by default. This makes sure that all dynamic quantum
    changes are disabled while a JACK app is running. The only way to force
    a quantum chance is through a JACK app or with the metadata.
  - It is now possible to do IPC calls from the data thread. Note that this
    is a very bad idea but required for compatibility with JACK2.

## GStreamer
  - GStreamer sink will now set a default channelmap to make it possible to 
    remap to the channel layout of the device.

# PipeWire 0.3.45 (2022-02-03)

    channelmap now. (#2068) It's also possible to configure latency and
    rate.
  - The native protocol now does extra checks for invalid data. (#2070)

## ALSA
  - TI2902 chips as found in various Behringer cards should have inputs
    again.
  - Better handling of busy devices in udev, retry when the inotify close
    event is emited.

## SPA
  - plugins now handle alignment properly and only expect the max alignment
    required for the CPU. (#2074)

## Bluetooth
  - SBC-XQ is now enabled for the JBL Endurance RUN BT headset.
  - Support for non-hexadecimal XAPL version strings to improve compatibility.
  - Use HCI commands again to probe the adapter msbc capability. This improves
    compatibility with some adapters. (#2030)
  - Set the right startup volume.
  - Better A2DP source idle handling.

  - Many small fixes and improvements.
  - Fix a pavucontrol crash with invalid channels. (#1442)

## JACK
  - Use the new force-quantum and force-rate properties in the JACK API to
    switch quantum and ensure it can't change for the lifetime of the JACK
    app. (#2079)

# PipeWire 0.3.44 (2022-01-27)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - It is now possible to run a minimal PipeWire server without a session
    manager, enough to run JACK clients.
  - The maximum buffer size is now configurable and can be larger than
    the previously hardcoded limit of 8192 samples. When using high sample
    rates, the larger buffer size can avoid xruns.
  - The default maximum latency was reduced from 170ms to 42ms. This should
    improve overall latency for application that ask for a large latency,
    such as notifications.
  - Better JACK compatibility. Patchbays should now get less confused about
    ports appearing and disappearing.
  - Fix some bluetooth crashes.
  - Fix some races in ALSA device detection.
  - Many bug fixes and improvements all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - Bump the meson requirement to 0.59.0.
  - pw-top now reports correct times for filter-chain and loopback.
  - max-quantum is now also scaled with the rate. A new quantum-limit
    property was added as a hard limit for the quantum. This makes it
    possible to configure for larger than 8192 buffer sizes. Note
    than many JACK applications have a hardcoded 8192 limit. (#1931)
  - The max-quantum was reduced to 2048, This gives a 42ms default
    latency. (#1908)
  - pw-filter can now return a NULL buffer from _get_dsp_buffer().
  - Add a PIPEWIRE_RATE and PIPEWIRE_QUANTUM env variable to set the
    graph rate and the graph quantum and rate respectively.
  - Fix a potential file descriptor leak in the connection.
  - A new minimal.conf file was added to demonstrate a static setup
    of a daemon that doesn't require a session manager and is able to
    run JACK applicaions.
  - Nice levels are now only changed on the servers, not the clients.
  - Add an option to suspend nodes when idle.
  - Make it possible to avoid quantum and rate changes with
    pw-metadata. This is essential in a locked down system.
  - Handle mixer port errors better and fail to create the link instead
    of silently not working.
  - Nodes that are moved to a driver now have all the linked nodes moved
    as well. This makes it possible to run some graphs without a
    driver, such as paplay -> zita-j2n.
  - pw-cli and pw-dump can now also list objects by name, serial and
    object.path using glob style pattern matching.


## modules
  - filter-chain can now also configure parameters by index.
  - Fix the client name of module-protocol-simple. (#2017)
  - module-rtkit was merged into module-rt. This makes it easier to
    ship a default config that works on more systems by default.

    Previously, this was a task only performed by the session manager.
  - module-metadata can now also create metadata object from the
    config file.
  - The ROC module should now work again. (#2045)
  - An X11-bell module was added to handle X11 bell events. (#1668)
  - filter-chain and loopback modules now have better unique default
    names for the streams, which makes it possible to save and restore
    their volumes independently. (#1983)
  - module-echo-cancel now has properties to control the delay and
    buffer size.

## ALSA
  - The monitor names are now correctly parsed.
  - The default period size for batch devices is limited now to avoid
    large latency.
  - The unused min/max-latency properties were removed.
  - Internal latency is now also configurable with params at runtime.

    permission changes when switching VTs.

## SPA
  - Fix potential infinite loop in audioconvert.
  - The spa-resample tools can now also use optimized implementations.
  - Fix a potential crash in resampler. (#1994)
  - audioconvert can now also handle F64 formats. (#1990)

    when downmixing is active.
  - The channelmixer will now generate LFE channels when the lfe_cutoff
    frequency is set, even when upmix is disabled.
  - The channelmixer will now always generate FC when the target has it.
  - Adapter now reports latency correctly, even after linking the monitor
    ports.
  - Reduce memory usage and preallocated memory in some of the
    audioconvert nodes.
  - Many properties are now exposed in adapter, such as the resample
    quality.
  - The resampler and channelmixer can now be disabled.

## V4L2
  - pw-v4l2 now also works for ffplay. (#2029)
  - Take product names from udev now that the kernel returns a generic
    name.

## JACK
  - The jack pkgconfig file now has the `jack_implementation=pipewire`
    variable to be able to distinguish jack implementations. (#1666)
  - jconvolver now starts correctly again. (#1989)
  - The object.serial is now used for the port_id. This makes it easier
    to track old objects in the cache.
  - Add a dummy jacknet implementation. (#2043)
  - A bug in the port allocation was fixed that would make it impossible
    to allocate ports at some point. (#1714)

## Bluetooth
  - Bluetooth profiles are now saved properly by the session manager.
  - Improved profile detections, increased timeouts for slow devices.
  - Implement HFP call indicator for improved compatibility.
  - Handle the case where bluez does not set the adapter or address
    properties on the device instead of crashing.
  - Improved support for setting the profile from the session manager.

## pulse-server
  - Monitor sources now have the device.class=monitor for better
    compatibility.
  - Behaviour after seeking is improved. The algorithm for requesting
    bytes from the client was simplified and improved. (#1981)
  - module-ladspa-sink implements the control argument now. (#1987)
  - A potential memory leak in the message queue was fixed. (#1840)
  - Use the object.serial for the pulseaudio object index. The index is
    not supposed to be reused and this would cause problems with some
    clients.
  - Servers should now again be able to listen in IPv4. (#2047)
  - module-x11-bell was added. (#1668)
  - There is now support for per-application quirks and properties in
    the pipewire-pulse.conf file. Per-application latency and buffering
    properties can also be configured.
  - Fix a regression in telegram sounds not playing.

# PipeWire 0.3.43 (2022-01-05)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Flatpak apps such as Ardour can now remove links again.
  - Many fixes to pulse-server. Memory usage should be improved. Some
    crashes are fixed. Underrun handling should work better. Better
    compatibility with GStreamer based applications after seeking.
  - Many of the samplerate and quantum changes bugs in previous releases
    were fixed. This fixes some issues where the microphone would fail
    to work.
  - Many more small fixes and improvements all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - Quantum and rate changes are now applied immediately when the driver
    is idle. This avoids setting the driver in the previous samplerate.
    (#1913)
  - Object destruction now does not need write permissions anymore. This
    restriction needs some more work. (#1920)
  - When we reposition, start a sync operation. This fixes a problem
    in Ardour when seeking. (#1907)
  - Require meson 0.56.0
  - Make the align property in BUFFER_PARAM optional. We now only set this
    if the plugin has specific requirements and we default to the CPU
    largest alignment requirement.
  - pw-record will now also list monitors and streams as possible targets.

## modules
  - Improve LV2 plugin support in filter-chain. Add support for Worker and
    Options.
  - The loopback module now has a unique media.name to make it possible
    for the session manager to restore unique volume settings.

## SPA
  - Improve sample rate for EAC3 streams, some clients scale it while
    others don't so use some heuristics to make things work better.
    (#1902)
  - Allocate ports dynamically in audioconvert. This avoids using larger
    memory blocks of preallocated memory that confuses the allocator.
    (#1840)

## ALSA
  - Merge the latest pulseaudio UCM improvements. (#1849)
  - Fixes for selecting the sample rate. (#1892)
  - Improve latency on USB devices by scaling the period size based on
    the desired quantum when the device is opened.
  - Add api.alsa.period-num to configure the amount of periods to use
    in the device. Some devices have lower latency when a small value
    is forced. (#1473)
  - Allow multi-rate by default. In previous versions cards could only
    be opened in one samplerate to avoid bugs in pre 5.16 kernels. This
    however caused other problems so the default was removed.
  - Fix a bug where a card was not freed correctly.
  - Fix a bug in the alsa boundary check that could hang the alsa-plugin
    for a long time.
  - The ALSA plugin now has a parameter to configure the allowed
    samplerates.

## JACK
  - Improve handling of monitor nodes.

## Bluetooth
  - Codecs now have a priority. This should improve codec selection.

## pulse-server
  - The stream FIX_ flags are now implemented. (#1912)
  - Improve flushing and draining behaviour. Short samples will now
    play correctly. (#1549)
  - Fix a crash when enumerating the formats. (#1928)
  - Track quantum changes and update the amount of required buffering
    accordingly. This improves forced quantum handling. (#1930)
  - Improve handling of channels > 32.
  - Handle the case where a module is destroyed before it could be
    completely loaded.
  - Fixes some issues when samples were removed while they were playing.
    (#1953)
  - Fix some issues in module-zeroconf-publish.
  - Fix some memory leaks in module-roc.
  - Add command access control. This avoids execution of commands without
    proper authentication.

# PipeWire 0.3.42 (2021-12-16)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

This is a quick emergency release to fix some severe
problems with the previous release.

## Highlights
  - Fixes a bug in pulse-server underrun handling that broke qemu
    and orca.
  - A fix was added to pulse-server to handle quantum changes
    gracefully.
  - Fix module-echo-cancel again.
  - Fix a bug where the bluetooth headset capture was producing
    noise.


# PipeWire 0.3.41 (2021-12-13)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Improved compatibility for flatpaks. Flatpaks with newer PipeWire
    version can connect to an older server in all cases.
  - A new RAOP module was added to stream to Apple Airplay devices.
  - OBS can now capture from the monitor devices again when using
    WirePlumber.
  - Improved JACK compatibility. Improved stability in Carla and Ardour
    when changing buffer size. Improved latency calculations and
    playback latency in Ardour.
  - Improved pulse-server handling of underruns and buffer size changes.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - The systemd service files now have better names.
  - client.access permission checks are improved.
  - Fix some memory leaks in error paths.
  - Objects now have a global serial number that is unique for the
    lifetime of the server.
  - Make clock.rate, clock.allowed-rates and clock.quantum
    runtime tunable parameters with the settings metadata.
  - Add some additional memory checks in client-node to avoid
    sending invalid memory to clients. (#1859)
  - Improve buffer memory allocation. If one of the nodes is a
    remote node, ensure we only use memory that can be shared.
  - Version checks when binding to objects is removed. This means
    that newer clients can now bind to older servers, which is
    a typical case for a flatpak.
  - A bug in the latency calculations was fixed where it would in
    some cases report the wrong minumum latency.

## modules
  - module-echo-cancel has voice-detection enabled now.
  - module-raop-sink and module-raop-discover to stream audio to
    an Apple Airplay device.
  - module-filter-chain now has preliminary support for LV2
    plugins.

## SPA
  - The audio resampler now has improved buffer size calculations.
    In some cases it was too small and would cause distortions.
  - More checks are done when doing volume changes so that the
    channelmap is correct.
  - Audioadapter now exposes most config options with params so that
    they can be adjusted at runtime.
  - The resampler can now calculate the expected input buffer size
    before receiving the first buffer, which avoids some confusion
    when starting streams.
  - Support was added for some 10bit video formats.
  - MONO channel handling was improved.
  - Most plugins now set a clock name and this is configurable where
    it makes sense. The clock.system.monotonic clock name is used
    for most plugins that use the system clock for timing.

## pulse-server
  - implement module-raop-discover
  - Use STREAM_CAPTURE_SINK property when capturing from a monitor
    source to better inform the session manager. This fixes some
    issues where OBS would capture from the microphone instead of
    the output monitor.
  - Limit the amount of cache messages to 16MB and don't add large
    memory blocks to the cache. This should fix some excessive
    memory usage that people reported.
  - Fix a potential memory leak when cleaning up a client.
  - Do some additional checks to avoid buffer overruns.
  - Improve recovery from underruns better. (#1857) This improves
    seeking in gnome-music.
  - Improve recovery when the quantum is forced larger that the
    stream configured latency.
  - The prebuf state is now handled correctly.

## JACK
  - A per type object cache is now implemented. This ensures that
    port objects remain valid for a longer time because many
    JACK applications inspect objects after they are destroyed.
    This improves catia/carla compatibility.
  - Recompute the latencies when the buffer-size changes. Fix some
    cases where we would end up with negative latencies.
  - Handle regcomp errors to avoid some crashes later.
  - Latency calculations are improved a lot.
  - More care is taken to not call a process callback while a buffer
    size change is pending. This fixes some crashes in Carla, which
    expect that all clients are paused when one handles the buffersize
    callback.
  - Loopback links to a client are now handled correctly and without
    latency. This fixes playback latency in ardour6 (#1839)

## ALSA
  - ALSA devices now keep track of the samplerate of the card and
    ensure that all PCM use the same rate. This is a workaround for
    a kernel bug that is fixed in 5.16.
  - Refactor the ALSA plugin a little.
  - The ALSA plugin now reports correct delay for a capture PCM. (#1697)
  - The ALSA nodes now expose all config options with params that can be
    changed at runtime.
  - The ALSA node has a configurable clock name. Adaptive resampling to
    match clock rates is avoided when the driver has the same clock
    name as the ALSA node. This can be used to link alsa devices together
    with a word clock.

# PipeWire 0.3.40 (2021-11-11)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Producers and consumers can now incrementally negotiate a format
    by narrowing down the options. This can be used to select an optimal
    combination of format and modifiers.
  - Driver nodes such as the consumer of a headless compositor can now
    throttle the speed based on a new trigger_done event.
  - Headless compositors can now signal a damage event to consumers
    to start the processing of the graph.
  - Compatibility improvements in JACK.
  - Draining and resuming is now working correctly in pulse and alsa.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Many BSD fixes.
  - clang compilation fixes.
  - Fix map implementation on big-endian machines.
  - Improve tracking of param changes in pw-stream.
  - Add support for renegotiation. With this change, producer and
    consumer can incrementally renegotiate a format until it is fixed.
    This will be used to do complex negotiation of DRM modifiers.
    (#1732).
  - Add a trigger-done event in the stream. This can be used to know
    when processing of the complete graph has finished after issuing
    a trigger_process() and it can be used to throttle processing.
  - Add a RequestProcess node event and command. This can be used by
    non-driver nodes to suggest to a driver to start processing. One
    case is where a compositor can emit this event as a result of a
    screen update to let the headless compositor start an update.
  - Fix zeroconf sample format.
  - pw-mon outputs to stderr now and has colors.

## SPA
  - Fix compilation on ppc and armv7.
  - Fix port type check for ALSA seq midi ports so that they are not
    falsely listed as hardware.
  - Fix crash when running SSE code on unsupported HW. (#1775)
  - The libcamera plugin was rewritten. It now supports hotplug,
    format enumeration and an easier to read codebase.
  - Fix compatibility some more for cards with 64 channels.

## pulse-server
  - Flush data in pause in combine-sink to avoid stray audio fragments.
  - Fix a race where not all objects were removed correctly.
  - The latency calculations and setup was improved to more closely
    match pulseaudio behaviour. PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC should now resemble
    pulseaudio more closely. (#1769)
  - The drained reply is now sent only once and new data will be
    accepted once the drain completes.
  - Fix a potential crasher bug where the stream started processing
    before the setup was completed.
  - The server will now drop the client connections when the pipewire
    connection is lost.

## JACK
  - Rework the jack_port_get_buffer() method to return the same memory
    when called multiple times during the process() callback. This makes
    things work on a new Hydrogen. (#1748)
  - Add an option to disable showing the monitor ports.
  - JACK ports are now sorted per node/client and port_id. This should
    more closely match JACK behaviour and avoid random port order.
    (#1780)

## v4l2
  - Fix v4l2 LD_PRELOAD script.
  - Make sure we destroy the proxy when the global is destroyed.

## ALSA
  - _prepare should exit the draining state. (#1467)
  - Fix the precision of the _delay function by taking into account
    the amount of queued samples are the correct samplerate.


# PipeWire 0.3.39 (2021-10-21)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - media-session is now moved into a separate module to speed up its
    deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
  - There is now an LD_PRELOAD v4l2 emulation library to run some existing
    v4l2 applications on top of PipeWire.
  - Filter-chains should now flush out remaining samples when paused. There
    is now also the option to let a filter-chain drain so that long filters
    such as reverbs can fade out properly.
  - Stability and compatibility improvements in JACK apps.
  - Better Bluetooth compatibility with more devices.
  - libcamera plugin improvements.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements all over the map.


## PipeWire
  - Fix compilation on ARM.
  - Log topics are added to most modules.
  - Documentation updates. Many improvements to the layout. Reorganisation
    of the modules and groups.
  - Share a work queue for all links and nodes. This removes the need for
    a separate eventfd per link and per node.
  - Catch errors in the map implementation.
  - Add option to compile without dbus support.
  - Fix biquad frequency. It was using the wrong sample rate.
  - Fix a potential crash when destroying nodes, in some cases the node
    would not be deactivated properly.
  - Add some more helpers for dealing with properties and their values.
  - Implement flush and reset on virtual sinks/sources.
  - Make it possible to let virtual sinks/filter-chains run and drain
    after being idle.
  - Fix a bug where the quantum could exceed the maximum because it was
    scaled with the sample rate.
  - Fix channel_map parsing in module-zeroconf-discover so that the remote
    channel map is used.
  - pw-stream errors emitted on the proxy are reported but not fatal
    any more. They are usually used by the session manager to signal status
    to the client but otherwise does not really cause an error on the
    client.
  - Links now also store the output and input node id in the global
    properties so that applications can parse and use them regardless of
    how the link was made. (#1723)
  - pw-stream and pw-filter now have an event to notify commands.
  - The echo-cancel module can now operate on larger quantums.
  - pw-cat now uses the right metadata to find the default devices in
    --list-targets.

## media-session
  - Don't try to remix unpositioned streams when linking. This ensures
    that linking to Pro-Audio nodes does not remix the stream channels
    but links them as they are, one by one.
  - media-session is now moved to a separate module to accelerate its
    deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.

## SPA
  - Many libcamera improvements, handle MemFd buffers, handle errors
    gracefully.
  - Small improvements to make interface fall-backs easier to implement.
  - Add support to enable flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero to avoid
    high CPU usage when dealing with denormals.
  - AUX13 channels are no longer reported as AUX12. (#1727)
  - Devices with more than 32 channels in Pro-Audio mode now only
    uses AUX channels.
  - Improve windowing function of the resampler to reduce aliasing and
    improve the quality.

## JACK
  - Port connect callbacks will not only be emitted after the port
    has negotiated buffers, which improves compatibility with
    applications that try to use the port right after the callback
    (jack_midi_latency_test).
  - Fix crash when midi ports were removed and being monitored, like
    in Ardour.

## pulse-server
  - The pulse tunnel will now use the specified format/rate/channels.
  - Improve lookup of default source and fall back to the monitors when
    no sources are available.
  - Mark some nodes as network nodes so that we can set the NETWORK flag
    correctly.

## GStreamer
  - The GStreamer element not releases the buffers in the stream again in
    all cases so that they can be reused by other streams.

## v4l2
  - Add a v4l2 LD_PRELOAD library to emulate v4l2 system calls on top of
    PipeWire. This is tested with firefox and GStreamer and is known to
    not work with Chrome.

## Bluetooth
  - AAC compatibility improvements.
  - Disable hardware volume for "Tribit MAXSound Plus" and
    "SoundCore mini".
  - Add quirk to disable faststream. Disable faststream on "FiiO BTR3".
  - Add a dummy AVRCP player to improve compatibility with some devices.


# PipeWire 0.3.38 (2021-09-30)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Topic based logging was added to improve debugging.
  - An off-by-one error was fixed in the audio resampler that could
    cause distortion when downsampling.
  - Various bluetooth compatibility improvements.
  - More fixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - module-pulse-tunnel now has better default latency to make it work
    better in more cases. There is also an option to configure the
    desired latency.
  - pw-cli now has readline support.
  - Topic based logging was added. Log lines can now be filtered by
    topic using wildcards. This should improve debugging.
  - The systemd service files should now have better descriptions.
  - Fix a crash in module-zeroconf-discover when unloading.
  - Fix a crash in filter-chain when using unaligned memory.

## ALSA
  - Sync the udev rules and profiles with pulseaudio.
  - Fix a memory leak.

## SPA plugins
  - An off-by-one error was fixed in the resampler that could cause
    distortion when downsampling. (#1646)

## Bluetooth
  - Avoid probing the native backend because it might block for DBus
    activation. This fixes some long startup times.
  - Fix the kernel version check, 5.14.x kernels should also support
    mSBC.
  - Fix FastStream microphone support in more cases.
  - Add workaround for Intel AX200.
  - SCO sink should now also work in follower mode.

## PulseAudio server
  - Make the service file require a session manager.


# PipeWire 0.3.37 (2021-09-23)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Capture and playback is now avoided even more on unavailable
    devices. This should fix some issues where an unusable microphone
    was selected by default. It should now also again be possible
    to select an unavailable device as the default.
  - Native DSD audio playback is now supported. pw-cat can now also
    play DSF files with the -d option.
  - JACK stability improvements with buffer-size and samplerate
    changes in some apps.
  - Many cleanups and bugfixes all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - pw-metadata -d does not cause an infinite loop anymore. (#1622)
  - Increase some plugin buffer sizes to fix some issues with many
    channels. (#1620)
  - Protect the global plugin list with a lock. Make sure pw_init()
    is locked. Fixes some issues with concurrent ALSA plugin usage.

## media-session
  - Unavailable devices can be set as the default again. (#1624)
  - Do a better check if a device has available routes and avoid
    selecting devices with unavailable routes as default.
  - Media-session was moved to its own directory. It used to live
    in examples but it is past the example stage and it interferes
    with the build options for the real examples.

## Bluetooth
  - The hardware quirk database is now loaded by the plugin instead of
    the session manager. This makes it also work with wireplumber.

## ALSA
  - The ALSA mixer now handles device removal much better. (#1627)

## libcamera
  - Many fixes and improvement to the libcamera plugin. (#1513)

## pulse-server
  - Improve compatibility with pulseaudio module arguments.
  - Parse channel_map arguments in module-loopback. (#1486)

## JACK
  - Delay emitting the samplerate and buffersize callbacks until the
    client is active. This fixes some crashes with Carla and other
    JACK apps.

# PipeWire 0.3.36 (2021-09-16)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - A quick update with mostly only bugfixes and small improvements.
  - Capture and playback is now avoided on unavailable devices. This
    should fix some issues where an unusable microphone was selected
    by default.
  - MIDI output should not stop randomly now.
  - The GStreamer elements are much improved, cheese should work
    a lot better now.
  - Virtual sinks and sources should now always show up immediately.
  - JACK processing is now delayed until buffersize and samplerate
    are emitted. This should improve stability of many JACK apps.
  - JACK transport sync is now implemented correctly so that preroll
    in bitwig works.

## PipeWire
  - The module dir environment variable can now contain multiple paths.
  - Documentation now contains dot graphs of dependencies. (#1585)
  - config min/max/default quantum values are now scaled with the
    samplerate.
  - A potential crash was fixed where destroyed memory was still used
    by a node. This could cause crashes in cheese.

## pipewire-media-session
  - Only allow passthrough for passthrough formats (S/PDIF) for
    now. (#1587)
  - Improve bluetooth profile autoswitch.
  - Don't try to route audio to nodes with unavailable routes.

## ALSA
  - Pass the right AES bits to the alsa device when opening an
    S/PDIF stream.
  - Fix a bug in the MIDI bridge port management logic. When a port
    was added and immediately removed, output would stop.

## GStreamer
  - The GStreamer source now handles the flushing state correctly.
  - All blocking operations now have a 30 seconds timeout, to avoid
    infinite locks.

## Plugins
  - V4l2 Device formats and controls are now passed on the node, just
    like with audio devices.
  - audioconvert now also exposes the softMute property.

## JACK
  - Improve stability when changing buffer size and sample rate
    dynamically by pausing the processing until the application has
    handled the callback.
  - Improve handling of timebase master. When the master was moved to
    another driver, it did not attempt to become a new timebase
    master on the new driver. (#1589)
  - Implement transport sync to make preroll in bitwig work. (#1589)

## pulse-server
  - Fix an issue where virtual sinks/sources would not show up
    immediately. (#1588)


# PipeWire 0.3.35 (2021-09-09)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - S/PDIF passthrough over optical or HDMI is now implemented.
  - Some critical fixes to MIDI, draining of streams and various
    modules.
  - skypeforlinux should work better now after adding it to the
    quirks database.
  - Bluetooth codecs are now in separate plugins to make it easier
    to ship them.

## PipeWire
  - Drain was fixed in pw-stream. In some cases it would not clear
    the drain state correctly. Fixes the issue where speaker-test would
    only play one channel.
  - Loopback connections to a driver will now activate the driver. This
    fixes an issue where MIDI connections between devices or some
    applications (puredata) would not get any MIDI messages. (#1559)
  - The audiomixer can now mix more formats. Together with the passthrough
    improvements this can be used to avoid conversions to/from the DSP
    format in some cases.
  - Make sure we idle drivers when removing a node from it in all cases.
    JACK clients could keep a driver node busy.
  - Add new methods to accumulate object info. The old one was difficult
    to use when applications need to accumulate multiple changes.
  - A new interface to load modules has been added. Plugins can use this
    to ask the host (PipeWire) to load spa plugins.
  - Increase param buffer size to handle larger params. Nodes with a large
    number of channels would sometimes not have properties. (#1574)
  - Concurrent link negotiation that caused some links to not work,
    is now avoided. This fixes monitor ports in Ardour6.
  - Small tweaks to how the quantum and rate are handled when nodes move
    between drivers. Make node.lock-quantum work with node.latency

## PipeWire modules
  - The convolver plugin in filter-chain has been optimized some more.
  - The echo-cancel stream properties were improved so that it actually
    can remember the streams it links to. (#1557)
  - module-pulse-tunnel had the buffer attributes wrong and would cause
    high latency with older pulseaudio servers. (#1434)
  - module-roc had the properties configured wrongly, which would cause
    it to not work at all in most cases. (#1538)
  - There is now an example of a 7.1 virtual surround sink using the
    hesuvi impulse responses.
  - The convolver now supports dirac pulses as the IR.

## ALSA
  - UCM config is now cached per device, using up less memory. It also
    temporarily works around a problem in alsa-lib that is now being
    patched and rolled out. Should stop devices from disappearing when
    logging out and back in. (#1553)
  - Fix the MIDI clock rate matching. It was too sensitive to small
    changes and would spiral out of control and break MIDI rather
    quickly.

## pipewire-media-session
  - The media session can now save and restore IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs
    for the sinks.
  - Passthrough of IEC958 (S/PDIF) content is now possible. If the client
    and the sink contain a compatible set of codecs, an exclusive
    connection can be made between client and sink to pass the encoded
    S/PDIF content directly to the device.
  - Use new introspection info update methods to suspend nodes in all
    cases. Sometimes, nodes would fail to suspend because the state info
    was not evaluated.
  - The media session can now work in non-DSP mode, which will try to
    avoid any audio conversions between client and device when possible.
    But, this will also disable compatibility with JACK applications.

## Bluetooth
  - Bluetooth codecs are now compiled into separate plugins which are
    dynamically loaded. This makes it possible to change the plugin
    implementation or ship plugins separately without having to recompile
    the bluetooth module.

## PulseAudio server
  - Delay stream create reply until the stream is linked to a sink/source.
  - The device-restore extension is now implemented. This makes it possible
    to configure the IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs supported by the sink with
    pavucontrol.
  - skypeforlinux now uses the same quirks as teams to make the sinks
    show up in all cases. This fixes the issue of not being able to hear
    the remote end in skypeforlinux.

## JACK
  - Improve catia and carla compatibility by caching objects a little longer
    after being removed. (#1531)
  - JACK ports now notify the negotiated format correctly.
  - A potential deadlock was fixed when multiple threads would perform a
    call that would require a roundtrip.
  - Improve bufsize callback, it should not be called right after doing
    activate() but only when the buffersize changes later.
  - Add tweak to disable the process lock. Some older apps might not
    expect it. (#1576)

## Docs
  - man pages are now generated with rst2man.
  - DMA-BUF docs were updated.
  - Documentation updates.


# PipeWire 0.3.34 (2021-08-26)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.


## Highlights
  - Fixes some critical issues with previous release. Such as
    devices not showing up and default devices being lost.
  - Support for consumer driver streams to make the producer v-sync
    to the consumer monitor in a headless compositor setup.
  - Improvements to routing of streams.
  - Bluetooth battery status support for head-set profile and
    using Apple extensions. aptX-LL and FastStream codec support
    was added.
  - Internal latency of ALSA devices can now be configured.
  - A fast convolver was added to the filter-chain to implement
    virtual surround sinks or reverbs.

## PipeWire
  - Add support for streams that are driver nodes for the graph.
    This was already possible for source streams but it is now
    also possible for playback streams. This can be used to let
    a producer v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless
    compositor setup. (#1484)
  - State files are now stored in XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME. They will still be loaded from the config home
    if they are not in the new state home, to ease migration.
  - Set a driver on inactive nodes to make transport work in xjadeo.
    (#1491)
  - Fix parsing of filter-chain controls.
  - A new FFT based convolver was added to module-filter-chain. It
    uses a 0-latency 2 stage convolver with small FFT for the head
    and a large FFT for the tail of the convolution. A convolution
    can be used to implement IR based reverbs, HRIR surround sound
    or other convolution based operations. An example HRIR
    virtual surround sound sink has been added as well.
  - module-filter-chain was reworked a bit to support more config
    options for the plugins.
  - Endian conversion and alaw/ulaw formats are now supported for
    streams.
  - pw-cat will now suggest a samplerate for the graph.
  - SPA_PLUGIN_DIR can now search in multiple paths separated with
    a ':'.
  - Passthrough mode has been worked on and has been partially
    merged. S/PDIF definitions have been added and ALSA devices
    updated to report and configure S/PDIF formats. The session
    manager changes to fully configure and enable passthrough mode
    will hopefully be merged next time.
  - Fix a race in pw-stream where it would not always emit the
    right events.

## ALSA
  - Fix volume changed check. It was checking against the wrong
    value and this could cause rounding errors.
  - The ALSA plugin now also uses RT scheduling.
  - Fix the behringer UMC202 usb device id, it was using a generic
    TI chip ID that caused problems.
  - Fix USB devices that don't show up anymore. Use an ALSA
    workaround to fix this. (#1478)
  - Add a rule for the new firmware of Sennheiser GSX 1200.
  - ALSA sink and source can now use ProcessLatency param to configure
    the internal latency. The latencyOffsetNsec property is also
    exposed so that the latency can be adjusted in pavucontrol as
    well.

## media-session
  - Fix a critical issue where the default device was not remembered
    anymore when it was removed.
  - Fix the issue where some apps need to be restarted when nodes go
    away and reappear.
  - Improve routing of streams. Streams that have a specific target
    set will now be moved to the target when it appears instead of
    staying on the fallback.
  - Small memory leak fixes.
  - Try to switch back to the user selected profile after finishing a
    Bluetooth recording.

## Bluetooth
  - Add support for HF indicator 2 battery status.
  - Add support for XAPL battery status.
  - Set the Communication intended role for HFP profile.
  - Enable SBC-XQ by default if not disabled by quirks.
  - Fix some potential crashes due to excessive polling.
  - Add aptx-LL codec and enable duplex for aptx-LL devices.
  - Add FastStream codec. This is a codec that can use a
    duplex SBC channel.

## PulseAudio server
  - Suggests a samplerate for the graph.
  - Support for handling S/PDIF (IEC958) formats was added. This will
    start working when the session manager supports configuring streams
    and nodes in passthrough mode.
  - Be smarter when handling devices without a negotiated format
    yet so that they are visible as well. This makes virtual
    devices show up immediately.

## ALSA plugin
  - Now suggests a samplerate for the graph.

## JACK
  - The jack.pc file can only be generated with meson >= 0.59.0. When
    the jack-devel option is enabled, it will generate an error with
    older meson.
  - Small stability improvements when connecting/disconnecting in
    Ardour.


# PipeWire 0.3.33 (2021-08-05)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Better support for virtual sinks/sources for Pro Audio
    profile.
  - Better DMA-BUF format modifier negotiation.
  - Support multiple sample rates in the graph. Not enabled
    by default yet.
  - Bluetooth can now automatically switch between headset
    and audio profile.
  - Documentation updates.
  - Many improvements and crasher fixes.

## PipeWire
  - Make AUX channels an official channel map, use this for the
    PRO audio profile so that we can name the channels. This
    make it possible to define virtual sources and sinks for
    Pro Audio devices in a more reliable way.
  - Fix scheduling of some virtual sinks/sources. (#1407)
  - Fix potential corruption of ringbuffer because of multiple
    concurrent writers. This might be the cause for many reported
    crashes. (#1451)
  - Don't place sockets in $HOME. (#1443)
  - Improve DMA-BUF negotiation. Add a flag to avoid fixation
    of a property so that producers can negotiate more
    efficiently. This is used to negotiate DMA-BUF modifiers,
    which should make more efficient use of the GPU. (#1084)
  - Add support for multiple sample rates. The graph can switch
    when IDLE to one of the supported rates. Add an option to
    lock the rate as well. This is not enabled by default yet
    because of driver bugs that need to be worked around first.
  - Add node.lock-quantum property that can be used to lock the
    quantum in place.
  - Improve latency reporting in the loopback module.
  - Make new client-node method to send the peer port id to the
    mixer. This can be used to know where the buffers entering the
    mixer are coming from. (#1471)

## Tools
  - pw-top should now also correctly show bluetooth devices. (#1540)

## media-session
  - Handle unset of the default node.
  - Added a module that can switch the bluetooth profile to headset
    profile when a stream wants to record from it.

## JACK
  - Only call the jack callbacks when the client is active. Some
    JACK applications don't expect callbacks before the client is
    active and crash (x42-dpl). (#1461)
  - Emit client unregister event.
  - Add per-client match rules in the config file to set app
    specific configuration and tweaks. (#1456)
  - Use peer_id to implement jack_port_get_buffer() from one of
    our peer ports to get the data before it enters the mixer.
    Makes the capture monitors work in Ardour6.8. (#1471)

## Bluetooth
  - Add some broken kernel versions to the mSBC blocklist
  - Avoid looping and consuming CPU when we can't write to the
    BT socket.
  - Use libfreeaptx instead of libopenaptx.
  - Fix rounding errors in HW volume conversion.

## PulseAudio server
  - implement module-switch-on-connect to emulate pulseaudio
    behaviour of new devices. Some desktop environments expect
    this behaviour and break otherwise.
  - Fix stream cleanup, make sure the stream is stopped before
    destroying it. Might be cause for some of the reported
    crashes.
  - Update message API to use the JSON format.

## Other
  - Many documentation updates.
  - Many cleanups and small improvements.
  - Support the latest libcamera version. (#1435)


# PipeWire 0.3.32 (2021-07-20)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Real-time priority handling for threads was reworked. Freewheeling
    will now drop RT priorities to avoid being killed.
  - Problems with filter chains and echo-cancel being linked in a loop
    was fixed.
  - alsamixer should now be able to see the mixer controls again.
  - JACK has seen some latency reporting improvements that make Ardour
    report latencies correctly.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Fix a bug in the neon audio resampler code.
  - There is now a node.link-group property to relate linked streams.
    this can be used to track the dataflow with coupled streams.
  - Fix a crash when recalculating latency on a destroyed port. (#1371)
  - Filter chains and other modules that create streams can now also
    be added to the daemon config itself. (#1309)
  - Fix some potential deadlocks in timerfd. (#1377)
  - Feedback links are skipped when recalculating latency to avoid
    loops.
  - The dummy driver and null-sink now stop the timerfd when following
    another driver instead of generating useless graph wakeups.
  - rt.limit was increased to 2 seconds. Some applications got killed
    because they run lengthy code in the Real-Time thread. (#1344)
  - Fix s24_32 to float, it was not sign extending properly. (#1393)
  - The performance of the feedback loop check algorithm was improved
    a lot, making complex graphs start much much faster.
  - The zeroconf publish module now doesn't republish nodes every time
    the volume changes. (#1406)
  - A potential memory corruption error has been fixed in the loop
    that could cause random crashes.
  - Mempools can now be created from multiple threads at the same
    time.

## media-session
  - Loops in coupled streams are now avoided. (#1394)
  - Port changes for inactive profiles are ignored now by the
    default-route module. (#1403)

## ALSA
  - Make sure that alibpref is not part of the device node name because
    it is random. (#1362)
  - Fixed an off-by-one that could cause midi events to end up with a
    wrong timestamp and thus being discarded by some apps. (#1395)
  - Fix some memory leaks when destroying a card object.

## JACK
  - Fix some invalid cycle wakeups that could cause JACK application to
    run with a 0 buffer size. (#1386)
  - JACK can now use rtkit to manage realtime priorities on threads.
  - The Real-time priority is dropped when entering freewheel mode to
    make sure we don't get killed when using too much CPU.
  - jack_recompute_total_latencies() is now implemented, fixing the
    latency reporting in Ardour. (#1388)
  - Fix some overflows in time calculations.
  - Ensure frame_rate in position is never 0.
  - Graph callbacks are now emitted as well.

## Bluetooth
  - RTP payload type is now set correctly for aptX, LDAC and SBC, which
    should improve compatibility with devices that care about this.

## PulseAudio server
  - There is now a quirks database to deal with bad clients. The database
    is builtin but can be made external later.
    - Teams is now lied to and told all sink/sources use s16 samples to make
      it show all sinks/sources.
    - Firefox is forced to remove the DONT_MOVE flag on capture streams so
      that you can move firefox streams with other tools.
  - The UNDERFLOW warnings are now made into info log messages to not
    spam the log too much. Many application just let things underrun
    and PulseAudio did not warn about this either. (#910)

## ALSA plugin
  - The alsa plugin now uses the right metadata for finding the default
    source and sink, which makes the volume controls reappear. (#1384)

## Other
  - Cleanups in pulse-server and pipewire.
  - Documentation additions.

# PipeWire 0.3.31 (2021-06-28)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fixes for alsa-lib 1.2.5
  - New pulseaudio modules: module-avahi-zeroconf,
    module-pipe-source, module-roc-sink, module-roc-source.
  - JACK has seen massive stability improvements. Locking
    and correctness wrt to callbacks has been reworked. Also
    thread priorities have improved.
  - Handle various crashes and lockups when running out of file
    descriptors.
  - Bluetooth now uses a hardware database to disable
    non-working features on listed devices.
  - Scheduling quantum and rate can now be changed dynamically
    with pw-metadata.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Improve cleanup of context in error cases.
  - There is now a pw-test framework for improved unit tests.
  - Improve property serialization to valid JSON.
  - Fix some macros to work with better with coverity.
  - Metadata permissions are checked now. Clients need the
    M permission on an object to be able to set metadata for
    it.
  - The core metadata object will now remove metadata for
    removed objects, the implementor does not need to worry
    about that anymore.
  - Audioadapter will now follow the rate of the graph with
    the resampler adjusting itself dynamically.
  - Core now has a metadata implementation helper. A context
    will expose a metadata with settings that can be changed
    at runtime. This can be used to change the loglevel or
    graph quantum and samplerate on the fly.
  - An infinite loop was fixed in the audio converter.
  - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully. Handle truncated
    control data by dropping the client connection.
  - Fix profiler crash with many streams.
  - Improve latency handling in pw-filter. There is now a
    default handler and a ProcessLatency parameter to simplify
    latency reporting.
  - Latency reporting was improved in devices and streams.
  - And example sink/source was added.

## ALSA
  - hardware mute and volume are now properties on the
    Route param to make things easier.
  - More fixes for alsa-ucm 1.2.5.

## Tools
  - spa-json-dump now properly encodes string and keys.
  - pw-dump now shows the correct subject of the metadata.


## PulseAudio server
  - Ensure the node.description is set, some applications
    crash otherwise (TeamSpeak).
  - Module loading and unloading was improved.
  - module-avahi-zeroconf was implemented.
  - module-pipe-source was implemented
  - module-roc-sink and module-roc-source was implemented.
  - The maximum amount of connections has been limited to 64,
    like pulseaudio.
  - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully.
  - Fix overflow of read/write pointers.
  - Source and sink state are now decoupled from the monitor
    state and will report IDLE when not playing anything.

## media-session
  - Port switching should now happen to/from the port that
    actually changed.

## JACK
  - The locking was reviewed. All callbacks are now emitted
    from the PipeWire thread with the lock released and
    the process function will be disabled for the duration
    of the callback. This ensures that no two callbacks are
    called at the same time.
  - Improve internal consistency and try to never call callbacks
    with invalid objects.
  - Monitor port can now be accessed with system:monitor_%d
  - client threads are now created with SCHED_FIFO and module-rt
    is used to create the other RT threads. This should avoid
    SIGKILL from RTKit in some cases.

## Bluetooth
  - Various bugfixes to improve connections to devices.
  - Handle delayed UUID connection.
  - There is now a hardware database that can disable features
    in listed devices.
  - Use libusb to detect availability of mSBC.

## ALSA
  - The virtual device name can now also contain a media role.

with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Latency reporting is now implemented.
  - Many documentation updates and cleanups.
  - module-combine-sink was added to PulseAudio server.
  - Better handling of multichannel input profiles.
  - Fix 100% volume issue when monitor suspends or profile
    changes in some cases.
  - Bugfixes and crashes


## PipeWire
  - A new module-rt was added to acquire real-time scheduling
    privileges without using RTKit.
  - Documentation fixes and updates. Docs are now using a
    custom theme.
  - There is now a MANDATORY flag on properties that influence
    how properties are filtered.

    contains a colon separated list.
  - Move `#pipewire` IRC channel to oftc.net.
  - Fix an error where param changes were not emitted in all
    cases.
  - Implement Latency reporting. Latency values are propagated
    through the graph so that each node knows the latency to
    the output/input device. Synchronization in pw-stream has
    been updated to use this.
  - Some more upmix cases are added so that LFE, SIDE and REAR
    can be generated from a mono channel as well.
  - pw-stream and pw-filter will now emit the process event from
    the real-time thread in a safe way, potentially avoiding some

    the channel mixer. Channels should now play on the right
    speakers in all cases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Small fixes and improvements in JSON parsing and encoding.

    correct.
  - Fix bug with repeating audio at the end of playback because
    the drain in the resampler was not draining all channels.
  - RTKit default rt.prio has been increased to 88. This will
    likely still be clamped to 20 until distros increase the
    max priority.

  - Move some of the configurable parameters to the config file.
  - Fix a fatal use after free when playing samples
  - Improve module handling. loaded modules now show up in the
    list of modules and can be unloaded. This also prepares the
    core for more module implementations later.

  - Use the context data thread instead of making our own. This
    fixes the issue where the data thread was not given RT
    priority correctly.
  - Pass extra jack flags around in port properties. This makes
    CV ports in carla work.
  - Many tweaks to the port names and aliases. Unwanted characters
    are filtered out, giving better names to jack apps. Default
    device names are now equal to those seen in pulseaudio apps.
  - Add an option to make a separate client for the monitor ports
    of a device. This makes it more usable in apps.
  - add support for system:playback_N and system:capture_N port
    names for apps that hardcode these port names.

    them.

- PulseAudio server
  - Implement the suspend command
  - Fixes volume in sample info

  - pactl stats will now work
  - Fix excessive memory usage when a capture client doesn't
    read fast enough.

PipeWire 0.3.19

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Startup after login should be fixed now with inotify
    used to wait for permissions.
  - Channels should be mapped correctly now.
  - Many bluetooth improvements in LDAC, AptX-HD. AAC was
    also added. Headsets should work better now.
  - pipewire-libpulse was removed. It is now completely
    replaced by pipewire-pulse.
  - Fix a crasher bug in pipewire-pulse and some memory leaks.
  - Fix a bug with feedback loop that would cause 100% CPU.
  - A new pw-top tool to display real-time graph performance.
  - The example session manager now has config files.
  - The config file format was changed to use the SPA JSON
    tokenizer. This makes it more flexible and extensible.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Fix debug of id in format channels
  - Audioconvert should now remap channels correctly in all
    cases.
  - Feedback loops were not scheduled correctly and would
    cause 100% CPU usage.
  - Small improvements to the profiler to also log incomplete
    graph status.
  - a new tool pw-top was added that prints real-time performance
    stats of the graph.
  - the rtkit module now sets the nice level to -11

- Session-manager
  - The session manager would sometimes link dont-reconnect
    nodes to another node, which would leak monitor streams in
    pipewire-pulse.
  - The session manager now has configuration files. Config files
    can also be placed in the user home directory to make custom
    configurations.
  - The session managers now creates unique device and node
    names for alsa and v4l2 devices.

    qjackctl work in more cases.


PipeWire 0.3.18

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - More work in the PulseAudio server. It should be compatible
    with more applications.
  - Bluetooth now support extra codecs such as AptX/HD and LDAC.
  - Support for virtual sources and sink was improved a lot.
  - Added a new pw-dump tool to dump the objects in JSON formats
    and for filtering them with tools like jq.
  - Many more stability fixes and improvements.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Silence some harmless warnings
  - pw-cli can now be used to set parameters.
  - Streams now perform the correct channel mapping when linked
    to non-standard multichannel devices. Previously channels
    would get swapped.
  - port, node and device params are now cached in the server.
    This avoids opening and closing devices whenever some client
    enumerates formats, which improves performance a lot,
    especially in cases where opening a device is slow.
  - Add a command to keep a device open during negotiation. This
    is used to enumerate and set a format while opening the
    device just once, improving performance.
  - The null-sink scheduling was fixed.
  - A memory corruption bug was fixed in format conversion, this
    could cause crashes, silent channels or other undefined
    behaviour.
  - There is now a simple JSON parser.

- Session-manager
  - Settings files are now stored in JSON. With the json parser
    this is easier to parse and extend

- Device support
  - Bluetooth now supports additional codecs: LDAC, AptX and
    AptX HD. LDAC is known to not work very well yet.
  - ALSA devices will now default to the max supported channels
    if nothing else is specified. This makes it possible to use
    8+ channel cards with the alsa-pcm module, which is not
    supported with the default alsa-acp module.
  - Enable mSBC support in oFono.
  - Add an option to disable hardware mixers
  - ALSA now improves support for batch devices.
  - The udev rules had references to Pulseaudio removed in order
    to not create conflicts.
  - Fix a potential crash in bluetooth devices when
    disconnecting.
  - UCM cards now use HW volume when possible.

- PulseAudio server
  - The id can now be used as the name to locate cards and
    devices
  - Report streams with planar formats as well
  - Better error reporting when stream create fails
  - module-null-sink can now handle channels, rate and
    channel_map properties
  - Add support for 3 types of virtual devices: source,
    sink and duplex.
  - set-port was fixed
  - Some buffer parameters were tweaked to improve
    performance, compatibility and stuttering with lower
    latency.
  - NULL can be used as a name for the device sink/source
  - Support lookup of monitor names
  - Set properties more like pulseaudio so that some
    clients (Teamspeak) don't crash anymore

PipeWire 0.3.17

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix crasher bug for kwin when screensharing stopped.
  - Massive improvements and compatibility fixes in the
    PulseAudio server.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ It will look for files there
    to activate session manager modules. Packagers can use
    this to only activate the audio modules when the PulseAudio
    server, libjack.so or the alsa modules are installed.

- PipeWire improvements
  - We now clear hooks before adding them. Some application
    did not clear them and had random data for the destroy
    callback.
  - Return -ENOENT from unknown resources so apps can handle
    this better. It's a common problem when an app tries to
    introspect and object but it disappeared before the message
    reached the server. Apps should ignore this.
  - channelmap information is now passed with the volume
    settings.
  - DMABuf is not mmapp()ed anymore with the FLAG_MAP_BUFFERS in
    the stream or filter. This is because DMABuf usually
    requires more that just a simple mmap and is better left
    for the application.
  - increase the maximum number of ports for a client-node.
  - adapter and node-factory now support the linger option to
    keep the objects alive after the creating client disconnected.

- Device support
  - ALSA now handles error in close(), like when unplugging a
    USB device.

- Session-manager
  - The session manager is now handling DONT_RECONNECT streams
    without a target node. They get connected to a default node
    once and then fail to reconnect.
  - The session manager now exposes the stream setting as
    metadata. This makes it possible for other components, such
    as pulse-server to use this information. Information is stored
    as a json object for easier consumption.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ packagers can use this

- PulseAudio server
  - Pulse server now acquire the dbus name.
  - Improvements in timing and compatibility with many apps.
  - The stream-restore extension is now implemented so that
    the event volume can be configured.
  - Many stability fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some issues with module-load/unload


PipeWire 0.3.16

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix screensharing for old 0.2 clients
  - Many pulse-server improvements. There is now a
    pipewire-pulse binary that is the preferred solution for
    PulseAudio compatibility. The replacement libpulse
    libraries are now deprecated. This also makes audio in
    Flatpak work.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Fix cleanup of listeners everywhere. Force remove of
    listeners in _destroy to avoid crashes.
  - Add support for a journald logger module.
  - Various memory leak fixes
  - Silence some warnings that spammed the logs.
  - Fix flush in pw_stream. This fixes small glitches when
    switching streams in music players.
  - Various FreeBSD fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some crashes when destroying objects.

- Device support
  - Reload the ALSA configuration when creating a node so that
    hotplugged devices work in all cases.
  - Fix memory leaks in ACP library. This also fixes issues
    where the mixer device was not closed.
  - Bluetooth now has support for the mSBC codec for SCO
    source and sink.

- pulse-server
  - Many introspection and compatibility improvements. It should
    now be as good or better than the replacement library.
  - Implement sample cache to make notification events work.

- JACK layer
  - handle errors when linking, fixes jack_connect hang when
    the ports were already linked.


PipeWire 0.3.15

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This is a quick update to fix critical issues with the
    0.3.14 update, which broke screen sharing and accidentally
    enabled the experimental pulse-server.
  - Fix some compatibility issues in pulse-server with
    pavucontrol and fix an issue that would block the complete
    server.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Permission checks for new clients are now done from a
    global context, which makes it possible to assign initial
    permissions to objects.
  - Handle EINTR everywhere
  - Fix an issue with the node state changes where a quick
    pause/play would hang a client.

- Session manager improvements
  - Disable the bluez5 and pulse-bridge modules by default because
    they interfere with pulseaudio. These options should only be
    enabled if pulseaudio is removed or disabled in the system.
  - Fix an issue where the session manager could end up in
    infinite recursion while scanning for things to do.
  - The session manager will now always configure nodes to remix
    to the channel configuration of the device. This fixes the case
    where mono streams would only end up on one channel of a stereo
    device.

- Device support
  - Initial merge of A2DP extra codec support using the new bluez5
    API.

- pulse-server
  - Create the runtime directory when it doesn't exist.
  - Don't ever block the server, use non-blocking IO everywhere.
  - Fill description of profiles with the name if not otherwise set,
    this fixes a crash in pavucontrol.
  - the connection debug category will now also debug pulse
    messages.
  - Respect the no_remix flag to make the control panel channel
    check work.

- ALSA plugin
  - implement pause


PipeWire 0.3.14

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This release focuses on bugfixes and stability
    improvements.
  - A new experimental pulse-server module was added. This
    module implements the pulseaudio protocol on top of
    PipeWire and can be used to make flatpaks work with
    PipeWire. It looks like this might be a better way
    forward compared to the libpulse.so replacement library.
  - A2DP bluetooth was reworked. Playback should work a lot
    better now. Support was also added to automatically link
    an A2DP source to a playback device, which makes it possible
    to use PipeWire as a bluetooth receiver as well.
  - Improvements to the routing and volume restore features
    of the session manager.


- PipeWire improvements
  - The channelmixer does not normalize volumes anymore. Volumes
    are only normalized for monitoring streams now.
  - Streams can actually start in the inactive state now.
  - The channelmixer can now also convert volume updates from one
    channel layout to another. This makes saved volumes work
    even when streams have different channel layouts.
  - Clients are only registered after the properties have been
    updated.
  - Links now have a new active state.
  - Drivers can now also specify a minimum quantum. This makes it
    possible for bluetooth devices to specify an optimum quantum
    for the given codec settings and MTU.
  - The amount of data sent over the socket was reduced by only
    sending the data that changed.
  - Client objects are now exposed after they uploaded their
    properties, which makes the new object more useful.

- Tools improvements
  - pw-cat will now add metadata to the PipeWire streams.

- Session manager improvements
  - Fix crashes when reading bad data in stored settings.
  - volume and routing is improved. Settings are now remembered
    per application or media-role.
  - The session manager remembers the last device used per stream
  - Fix a bug when moving streams where it could sometimes end
    up with linking a stream to multiple devices.
  - Use RTKit to set realtime priority on the data thread in the
    session manager. This improves performance of the pulse-server
    and bluetooth devices.
  - Add a new property to mark streams that want to capture from
    the monitor of the default sink.
  - NODE_TARGET can now also contain the node name. This avoids
    some lookups in the pulseaudio layer when selecting target
    nodes by name.
  - the -e and -d options are more usable now and can be used to
    add and remove modules from the default list of modules.

- Device support
  - v4l2: add some workarounds for buggy drivers. Add Limited
    support for droidcam.
  - ACP: improve selection of default port and profiles.
  - ACP: add support for using the hardware mixer for more than
    8 channel streams.
  - ACP: support the new port type and availability group found
    in PulseAudio.
  - A2DP bluetooth timings were reworked. Automatic linking of
    A2DP sources was added to make it possible for PipeWire to
    act as a bluetooth receiver. The code was reworked to allow
    other codecs such as APTX and LDAC in the future.
  - Try harder to recover from ALSA errors.

- GStreamer improvements
  - Fix some crashes in the monitor that cause
    gnome-initial-setup to crash.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Many compatibility improvements. Improved playback in
    chrome. Fix a crash in firefox when the daemon is stopped.
  - Fix a leak in the formats.
  - Fix !ADJUST_LATENCY streams like paplay.
  - Make the device option in paplay work.
  - Fix volume/mute notifications, this makes plasma volume updates
    work again.
  - Do the conversion between PulseAudio cubic volumes and PipeWire
    linear volumes. Volume levels should behave now like they did
    with PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Return an error when we run out of midi events. Some application
    rely on this behaviour.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  - The ALSA plugin now also supports the node name in the
    playback_node and capture_node properties.


PipeWire 0.3.13

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Add pw-reserve tool to reserve or monitor a device on DBus.
  - Install spa-resample, a tool to resample a file.
  - Install spa-acp-tool, a tool to inspect the card profile.
  - Various fixes and improvements
  - Fix a bug in pw-stream where a capture stream could run out
    of buffers and become silent.
  - Rework the processing loops in the adapter and stream. There
    is now less latency in PulseAudio and ALSA layers.

- Session manager improvements
  - Improve the device reservation code. We now try to acquire
    the device using the dbus device reservation API before we
    probe the device. This avoids conflicts with a running
    PulseAudio where devices would disappear (because they were
    locked by the other process).
  - Don't fail on invalid input from the config files.
  - Audio devices now have the same name as what PulseAudio
    would assign.

- Device support
  - v4l2: try to use the format before enumerating the size and
    framerate. Some drivers don't check the format and might now
    work better.
  - v4l2: Fall back to MMAP when EXPBUF fails. Fix MMAP access,
    just export the fd and the mapoffset. This should make more
    devices work.
  - Fix crash in ALSA Card Profile (ACP) code.
  - ACP: fix selection of default profile. Prefer any possibly
    available profile over 'Off'. This makes some card at least
    start with something.
  - Fix soft volume. After setting the volume to 0, it would stay
    at 0 until pushed over the max volume. This should fix
    various volume related issues.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Rework the buffering and latency measurements and tweak the
    buffer attributes. This should make browsers and media
    players work better. This should also improve speechd
    performance.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Fix compilation against newer JACK.


PipeWire 0.3.12

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * the channelmap converter now handles unknown and strange
    channellayouts much better.
  * the resampler is now cleared correctly, avoiding clicks and
    pops at the start of sound.
  * Fixes for various crasher bugs. (paplay drain, vlc shutdown,
    pactl info, ...)
  * Fix a race condition in the node state changes that caused
    all kinds of sync and other issues (vlc, mpv, ...)
  * Improve the binary name property of applications
  * Fix the scheduling again of nodes that always need a driver
    such as the jack clients.

- Session manager improvements
  * fix routing to default nodes. Sometimes nodes were not routed to
    the default node (bluetooth)

- Device support
  * disable channelmap from ALSA by default. This is what PulseAudio
    does and thus provides better compatibility.
  * fix a bug in how the resampler was used in the ALSA source,
    causing distortion and errors when using low latency capture
    clients. (Discord, webrtc, ...)
  * Small bluetooth improvements. More work is needed for reliable
    bluetooth playback.

- GStreamer plugins
  * the device provider now stops the processing loop before shutting
    down, which avoids crashes (gnome-initial-setup).

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * the buffer attributes were reworked to ensure compatibility with
    many more applications such as mpv and audacious.
  * the pulseaudio layer will now try hard to not hand out invalid
    channel maps to the application. (avoids crashes in
    gnome-volume-control). The channel map will now also look more
    like what PulseAudio does.
  * the @DEFAULT_SINK/SOURCE/MONITOR@ wildcards now work. This
    fixes the problem with volume keys when they are bound to
    scripts using pactl and the default sink/source wildcards.
  * the PIPEWIRE_LATENCY environment variable now works again
  * Fix some leaks of ports and port info. Also fix the leak of the
    context when the mainloop is stopped.
  * The sink/source format_info array is now filled up completely,
    this is actually not implemented yet in the real PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  * jack now returns version 3.0.0 and has PipeWire in the version
    string so that apps can report this.


PipeWire 0.3.11

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * Properly cleanup the mixer structures when a port is removed,
    this should fix client crashes related to port config changes
    and other random crashes.
  * Optimize the preferred formats in the audio converter. Higher
    quality formats with higher performance are chosen first.
  * Make sure the time reported by pw_stream is always increasing,
    even when the driver and clock changes.
  * There is now also a system service and socket that can be used
    to enable PipeWire systemwide. This is however not recommended
    and disabled by default.
  * Fix channelmixer 5.1 to stereo mix matrix. It was not reading
    the conversion matrix correctly and cause channels to be
    dropped. The channelmixer will now also normalize the volume,
    like what pulseaudio does.
  * The channelmixer will now just copy channels when no layout
    has been given. It has also optimized paths for this. This
    makes it possible for apps to request > 8 channels from the
    alsa plugin (ardour).
  * Port, Node and Link will now also emit an error on the
    resources in addition to updating the error in the info. This
    would make it easier to track negotiation errors in the session
    manager later.
  * many small fixes and cleanups.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ DOSBox: fix crash because of double free in pw_stream

- Session manager improvements
  * The session manager will now try to configure the client to
    the channel configuration of the sink/source. It will only
    do this for downmixing, never for upmixing and also never
    when the client has the dont-remix property set. It will
    also renegotiate the channel layout when moving a stream to
    a new sink/source.
  * Configuration state is now saved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    Previously it was saved in $HOME/.pipewire-media-session/
    You can migrate the state by moving the files to
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire-media-session (or
    $HOME/.config/pipewire-media-session as a fallback when
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).

- Device support
  * Bluetooth sources and sinks should work better now.
  * There is now also a new bluetooth backend using hsphfpd.
  * fix the ALSA UCM Off profile for alsa pcm devices
  * improve ALSA port and profile switching. The ACP device will
    now switch to the best port and profile when availability
    changes.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * Implement some more callbacks. The pulse layer will now also
    notify applications of stream moved, started and latency
    changes.
  * Fix error code when an object was not found. We now return
    PA_ERR_NOENTITY instead of PA_ERR_INVALID.
  * Add some support for loading new null sinks. Applications such
    as pulseeffects use this. Note that pulseeffects does not yet
    work reliably but can start now.
  * Improve handling of profile and port updates, it should work
    much more reliable now. Apps should now also again receive
    volume updates from sinks/sources.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ openal-soft 1.20
	+ pavucontrol (checks PA_ERR_NOENTITY)

- JACK layer improvements
  * improve default source and sink handling. It was not updated
    correctly in all cases.
  * add samplerate and period to the pw-jack wrapper to easily
    configure the desired samplerate and period for the app.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  * Add a mixer entry in the alsa config file.
  * Implement support for planar types, rework the processing
    function to make it more robust.
  * refuse to load the alsa plugin when linked against 0.2. This
    catches some old apps linked against 0.2 that want to use the
    alsa plugin.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ linphone (ALSA SIGFPE when _status() is called
	  before _prepare()).

PipeWire 0.3.10

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Many improvements to the pulse layer.
  * GStreamer pulsesink element now works.
  * Fixes some segfaults.
  * Enable rtkit for client threads.
  * fixes capture of monitor stream by name
  * implement some more extensions, this makes paman
    work and removes some warnings.

- Many improvements to the GStreamer elements
  * negotiation rework, avoid calling GStreamer methods from
    the PipeWire callbacks because they might block and cause
    deadlocks.
  * Add support for non-string property values.
  * improve stability after buffer and format
    renegotiation.
  * Rework the device provider.
  * pipewiresink can now provide a stream that can
    be consumed by apps like cheese.

- Many improvements to the JACK layer:
  * Rework the buffer_size callbacks. Make sure we call
    the callback from a 'safe' thread and that we don't
    call the process callback while the application is
    handling the callback. This improves stability in
    apps like Carla when PipeWire dynamically changes
    the buffer size.
  * Improve compatibility with apps that call
    get_buffer_frames() with a 0 size (calfjackrack)
  * JACK can now create nodes that can be set as a
    sink/source in PulseAudio/ALSA apps (you can make an
    effects rack and set that as default sink for
    apps).

- Added a group id property for nodes. This makes it
  possible to schedule nodes with the same driver even
  when they are otherwise not linked together. To make
  this work well a new flag needed to be added to nodes
  to signal when they are ready for processing.

  Together with the GStreamer fixes, this makes things
  like:

   gst-launch-1.0 -v pipewiresrc path=51 stream-properties="props,node.group=1" !
         audio/x-raw ! pipewiresink stream-properties="props,node.group=1"

  work as expected with PipeWire managing the resampling
  to keep the clocks of the devices in sync.

  This can later also be used to force devices to be grouped
  together to create a JACK-like scheduling group.

- Streams and filter now use PIPEWIRE_NODE and
  PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variables as fallback.

- ACP add per device port list. This makes UCM devices
  expose the right ports.

- Fix some segfaults in ACP and UCM.

- make pw-cat use the metadata to find default devices.

- The media session can now save and load audio device
  Profiles and Routes (volumes), stream volumes and
  the default sink and sources.

PipeWire 0.3.9

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix bad audio in chrome

- Remove some errors that are not real errors.

- Fix 100% cpu when disconnecting devices.

- Improve pulseaudio introspection of formats

- Fix JACK metadata handling, carla can now monitor the
  port it creates and insert midi.

- Add a new permission bit (M) that is needed to be able
  to configure metadata on an object. Improve security of
  metadata some more, only allow metadata on objects that
  are visible to the client setting the metadata.

- Add support for videocrop in the GStreamer elements.

- Improve handling of the runtime directory for the
  server sockets. Add some reasonable fallback when
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set, as suggested in the spec.

- Improve ALSA device names from ACP.

- Fix various crasher bugs. One in the pulse layer, one in
  the session manager.

- Make alsa plugin respect the PIPEWIRE_REMOTE env variable.

- Various compile fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.8

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix an embarrassing crasher in the JACK layer when
  metadata keys were removed.

- Make it possible to add properties to jack clients with
  a PIPEWIRE_PROPS env variable. This can be used to make
  JACK nodes look like a device (like an effects rack).

- Improvements in the session manager in how it links
  ports. Now it will try to link matching channels first
  and be more intelligent otherwise. The session manager
  will also configure the stream to the device port
  configuration when needed.

- Add ofono backend for Bluetooth HeadSet support.

- Improve default source and sink handling. They are now
  stored with their id, instead of name, in the metadata.
  This makes it work better with JACK because of JACK's
  limited name length.

- Improve environment variables to make it possible to
  create and connect to servers other than "pipewire-0".
  Implement this in pulseaudio, JACK and alsa layers.

- Add an alsa mixer plugin so that alsamixer works with
  PipeWire. It will configure the default source/sink
  volumes.

- Fix capture devices. There was something wrong with how
  the resampler was used that caused corruption in the
  signal when the resampler was active.

- We now ship alsa card paths, profile-sets configuration
  files and udev rules so that we don't have to rely on
  the pulseaudio ones.

- Many build and stability fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.7

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
  code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
  all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
  mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
  be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
  in how it presents and manages devices.
  Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
  and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
  it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
  compatibility layer for those who want to try.

- Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
  pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
  the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
  screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
  still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
  elements can now also share a connection between them.

- Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
  and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
  fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.

- Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
  where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
  memory.

- Support for passive links is added again. These are links
  that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
  This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
  to suspend as a group when not in use.

- Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
  the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
  to how links and node states were handled. More work is
  needed to implement more use cases.

- Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
  was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
  in reuse of the wrong memory.

- Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.

- Improved error handling in the session manager.

- Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
  sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
  to the default device. Changing the default device will
  move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
  respect the default source/sinks.

- Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
  a stream and the session manager will move streams when
  the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
  implement the move_stream feature.

- Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
  has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
  apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
  objects. Security related properties are made read-only
  now. Different access modules can now coexist.

- The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
   1) a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
   2) a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.

  jack applications with the right library path.


PipeWire 0.3.2

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- build fixes
- Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
  possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
  and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
  format.
- Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
- Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
  to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
  negotiate.
- Fix JACK midi output.
- Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
  AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
- Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
  shader.
- Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
  processing and use the values from the processing
  context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
- Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
  config file.
- Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
  cause the server to leak all buffers.
- Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
- Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
- Try to select higher quality formats first when
  negotiating a format with an audio device.
- Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
- Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
  do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
  pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
  default and has options to select a different server.
- Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
  samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.


PipeWire 0.3.1

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
  sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
  Only enable this for the jack library for now.
- Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
  signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
  the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
- Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
- improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
  warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
  started the operation or is the owner of the object.
- pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
  in verbose mode
- fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
- Fix and update some examples

- Fix buffer memory upload.
- jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
  install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
  handling.
- fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
- add support for control ports in pw_filter
- fix cleanup of the metadata module
- improve param enumeration.
- Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
- Add create-object command in the config file to create
  object from a factory.
- Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
  nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
- Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
  about a boolean.
- pulseaudio: improve compatibility


PipeWire 0.3.0

The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the development of
PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
layer with comparable performance to JACK2.

The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
development files and runtime paths are versioned so that
future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
existing applications.

PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
expected that future version will either switch to a more
flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
configuration options of the example session manager.

PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.

PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
to be somewhat problematic for now.
