SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
===========

Interact with a PipeWire instance.

When a command is given, **pw-cli**
will execute the command and exit

When no command is given, **pw-cli**
starts an interactive session with the default PipeWire instance
*pipewire-0*.

Connections to other, remote instances can be made. The current instance
name is displayed at the prompt. Some commands operate on the current
instance and some on the local instance.

Use the 'help' command to list the available commands.
