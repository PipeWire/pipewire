SYNOPSIS
========

*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire/pipewire.conf*

*@PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR@/pipewire.conf*

*@PIPEWIRE_CONFDATADIR@/pipewire.conf*

DESCRIPTION
===========

PipeWire is a service that facilitates sharing of multimedia content
between devices and applications.

On startup, the daemon reads a configuration file to configure
itself. It executes a series of commands listed in the config
file.

The config files are loaded in the order listed in the SYNOPSIS_.
The environment variables ``PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR``, ``PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_PREFIX``
and ``PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_NAME`` can be used to specify an alternative config
directory, subdirectory and file respectively.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
=========================

The configuration file format is grouped into sections. A section
is either a dictionary, {}, or an array, []. Dictionary and array
entries are separated by whitespace and may be simple value
assignment, an array or a dictionary. For example:

name = value # simple assignment

name = { key1 = value1 key2 = value2 } # a dictionary with two
entries

name = [ value1 value2 ] # an array with two entries

name = [ { k = v1 } { k = v2 } ] # an array of dictionaries

CONFIGURATION FILE SECTIONS
===========================

context.properties
  Dictionary. These properties configure the PipeWire instance.

context.spa-libs
  Dictionary. Maps plugin features with globs to a spa library.

context.modules
  Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is a dictionary with the *name* of the module to load,
  including optional *args* and *flags*. Most modules support being loaded
  multiple times.

context.objects
  Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is a dictionary containing the *factory* to create an
  object from and optional extra arguments specific to that factory.

context.exec
  Array of dictionaries. Each entry in the array is dictionary containing the *path* of a program to
  execute on startup and optional *args*.

  This array used to contain an entry to start the session manager but this mode
  of operation has since been demoted to development aid. Avoid starting a
  session manager in this way in production environment.
