Older versions:

PipeWire 0.2.94

Fifth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Fix man page names
- Fix jack set_sync_timeout
- Improve JACK compatibility with apps that cache buffer pointers.

PipeWire 0.2.93

Fourth pre-release for upcomming 0.3:

- Fix unit tests on 32 bits
- Append -pw version to pulse and jack libs. This way we can install
  it next to the real libraries and use a symlink to enable it.

  then also remove the eventfd from the data-loop, making it
  maybe a little faster.

- Don't fail when alsa is not found
- Fix some compiler warnings with a new spa_aprintf() helper.

It is mostly a bugfix release to make the new version install and
run correctly in distros.

- Install session manager, fix path to find the session manager
- Fix alsa buffer reuse
- Small fixes for crasher bugs
- Implement pw_core_set_paused() to suspend/resume even
  processing. This can be used when using multiple connections
  to a daemon and one needs to pause one connection until the
  other one completes an action. Used by session managers.
- Improve old version check


PipeWire 0.2.90

This is the first pre-release of the 0.3 version. It consists of a
major rewrite and is not API or ABI compatible with the 0.2
branch.


PipeWire 0.2.7

This is mostly a bugfix release and is API/ABI compatible with
previous 0.2 versions.

Work is ongoing in the work branch that features a completely new
scheduling method that will enable audio support. Some of these
API changes are backported in this branch.

- Add support for alsa-lib 1.1.9 which changed the include path
- Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
- deviceprovider: fix probing without starting
- add sentinel to some functions

- Revert object tree permission checks that broke things, this is
  probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
  be removed later)

- Fix some memory and fd leaks
- Fix compilation with C++ compilers and clang

	- Use the portal permissions store for camera checks
- Actually use the passed fd in pipewiresrc
- Make properties with "pipewire." prefix read-only
- Add security label to client object
- Enforce link permissions
