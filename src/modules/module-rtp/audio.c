		 * position (RTP timestamp + target_buffer), just like in the constant
		 * latency mode. Crucially however, in direct timestamp mode, it is assumed
		 * that the RTP timestamps are based on the same synchronized clock that
		 * runs the graph driver here, so the clock position is using the same
		 * time base as these timestamps.
		 *
		 * If the transport delay from the sender to this receiver were zero, then
		 * the data with the given RTP timestamp could in theory be played right
		 * away, since that timestamp would equal the clock position (or, in other
		 * words, it would be the present time). Since the transport takes some
		 * time, writing the data at the position (RTP timestamp + target_buffer)
		 * shifts the timestamp into the future sufficiently enough that no data
		 * is lost. (target_buffer corresponds to the `sess.latency.msec` RTP
		 * source module option, and that option has to be chosen by the user
		 * to be of a sensible size - high enough to at least match the maximum
		 * transport delay, but not too high to not risk too much latency
		 * Also, `sess.latency.msec` must be the same value across all RTP
		 * source nodes that shall play in sync.)
		 *
		 * When the code here reads from the position defined by the current
		 * clock position, it is then guaranteed that the data is accessed in
		 * sync with other RTP source nodes which also run in the direct
		 * timestamp mode, since all of them shift the timestamp by the same
		 * `sess.latency.msec` into the future.
		 *
		 * "Fill level" makes no sense in this mode, since a constant latency
		 * is not important in this mode, so no DLL is needed. Also, matching
		 * the pace of the synchronized clock is done by having the graph
		 * driver be synchronized to that clock, which will in turn cause
