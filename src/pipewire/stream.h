/** \page page_streams Media Streams
 *
 * \section sec_overview Overview
 *
 * Media streams are used to exchange data with the PipeWire server. A
 * stream is a wrapper around a proxy for a \ref pw_client_node with
 * just one port.
 *
 * Streams can be used to:
 *
 * \li Consume a stream from PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_INPUT stream.
 * \li Produce a stream to PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT stream
 *
 * You can connect the stream port to a specific server port or let PipeWire
 * choose a port for you.
 *
 * For more complicated nodes such as filters or ports with multiple
 * inputs and/or outputs you will need to create a pw_node yourself and
 * export it with \ref pw_remote_export.
 *
 * \section sec_create Create
 *
 * Make a new stream with \ref pw_stream_new(). You will need to specify
 * a name for the stream and extra properties. You can use \ref
 * pw_fill_stream_properties() to get a basic set of properties for the
 * stream.
 *
 * Once the stream is created, the state_changed event should be used to
 * track the state of the stream.
 *
 * \section sec_connect Connect
 *
 * The stream is initially unconnected. To connect the stream, use
 * \ref pw_stream_connect(). Pass the desired direction as an argument.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_mode Stream modes
 *
 * The stream mode specifies how the data will be exchanged with PipeWire.
 * The following stream modes are available
 *
 * \li \ref PW_STREAM_MODE_BUFFER: data is exchanged with fixed size
 *	buffers. This is ideal for video frames or equal sized audio
 *	frames.
 * \li \ref PW_STREAM_MODE_RINGBUFFER: data is exhanged with a fixed
 *	size ringbuffer. This is ideal for variable sized audio packets
 *	or compressed media.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_target Stream target
 *
 * To make the newly connected stream automatically connect to an existing
 * PipeWire node, use the \ref PW_STREAM_FLAG_AUTOCONNECT and the port_path
 * argument while connecting.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_formats Stream formats
 *
 * An array of possible formats that this stream can consume or provide
 * must be specified.
 *
 * \section sec_format Format negotiation
 *
 * After connecting the stream, it will transition to the \ref
 * PW_STREAM_STATE_CONFIGURE state. In this state the format will be
 * negotiated by the PipeWire server.
 *
 * Once the format has been selected, the format_changed event is
 * emited with the configured format as a parameter.
 *
 * The client should now prepare itself to deal with the format and
 * complete the negotiation procedure with a call to \ref
 * pw_stream_finish_format().
 *
 * As arguments to \ref pw_stream_finish_format() an array of spa_param
 * structures must be given. They contain parameters such as buffer size,
 * number of buffers, required metadata and other parameters for the
 * media buffers.
 *
 * \section sec_buffers Buffer negotiation
 *
 * After completing the format negotiation, PipeWire will allocate and
 * notify the stream of the buffers that will be used to exchange data
 * between client and server.
 *
 * With the add_buffer event, a stream will be notified of a new buffer
 * that can be used for data transport.
 *
 * Afer the buffers are negotiated, the stream will transition to the
 * \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state.
 *
 * \section sec_streaming Streaming
 *
 * From the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state, the stream can be set to
 * the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_STREAMING state by the PipeWire server when
 * data transport is started.
 *
 * Depending on how the stream was connected it will need to Produce or
 * Consume data for/from PipeWire as explained in the following
 * subsections.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_consume Consume data
 *
 * The new_buffer event is emited for each new buffer can can be
 * consumed.
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_peek_buffer() should be used to get the data and metadata
 * of the buffer.
 *
 * When the buffer is no longer in use, call \ref pw_stream_recycle_buffer()
 * to let PipeWire reuse the buffer.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_produce Produce data
 *
 * The need_buffer event is emited when PipeWire needs a new buffer for this
 * stream.
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_get_empty_buffer() gives the id of an empty buffer.
 * Use \ref pw_stream_peek_buffer() to get the data and metadata that should
 * be filled.
 *
 * To send the filled buffer, use \ref pw_stream_send_buffer().
 *
 * The new_buffer event is emited when PipeWire no longer uses the buffer
 * and it can be safely reused.
 *
 * \section sec_stream_disconnect Disconnect
 *
 * Use \ref pw_stream_disconnect() to disconnect a stream after use.
