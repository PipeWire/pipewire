/** \page page_thread_loop Threaded Loop
 *
 * \section sec_thread_loop_overview Overview
 *
 * The threaded loop implementation is a special wrapper around the
 * regular \ref pw_loop implementation.
 *
 * The added feature in the threaded loop is that it spawns a new thread
 * that runs the wrapped loop. This allows a synchronous application to use
 * the asynchronous API without risking to stall the PipeWire library.
 *
 * \section sec_thread_loop_create Creation
 *
 * A \ref pw_thread_loop object is created using pw_thread_loop_new().
 * The \ref pw_loop to wrap must be given as an argument along with the name
 * for the thread that will be spawned.
 *
 * After allocating the object, the thread must be started with
 * pw_thread_loop_start()
 *
 * \section sec_thread_loop_destruction Destruction
 *
 * When the PipeWire connection has been terminated, the thread must be
 * stopped and the resources freed. Stopping the thread is done using
 * pw_thread_loop_stop(), which must be called without the lock (see
 * below) held. When that function returns, the thread is stopped and the
 * \ref pw_thread_loop object can be freed using pw_thread_loop_destroy().
 *
 * \section sec_thread_loop_locking Locking
 *
 * Since the PipeWire API doesn't allow concurrent accesses to objects,
 * a locking scheme must be used to guarantee safe usage. The threaded
 * loop API provides such a scheme through the functions
 * pw_thread_loop_lock() and pw_thread_loop_unlock().
 *
 * The lock is recursive, so it's safe to use it multiple times from the same
 * thread. Just make sure you call pw_thread_loop_unlock() the same
 * number of times you called pw_thread_loop_lock().
 *
 * The lock needs to be held whenever you call any PipeWire function that
 * uses an object associated with this loop. Make sure you do not hold
 * on to the lock more than necessary though, as the threaded loop stops
 * while the lock is held.
 *
 * \section sec_thread_loop_events Events and Callbacks
 *
 * All events and callbacks are called with the thread lock held.
 *

/** \class pw_thread_loop
 *
 * \brief PipeWire threaded loop object
 *
 * The threaded loop object runs a \ref pw_loop in a separate thread
 * and ensures proper locking is done.
 *
 * All of the loop callbacks will be executed with the loop
 * lock held.
 *
 * See also \ref page_thread_loop
