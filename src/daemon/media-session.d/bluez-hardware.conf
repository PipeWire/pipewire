# List of hardware/kernel features, which cannot be detected generically.
#
# The `feature` is enabled only if all three of adapter, device, and
# kernel have it.
#
# For each of the adapter/device/kernel, the match rules are processed
# one at a time, and the first one that matches is used.
#
# Features and tags:
#     msbc              "standard" mSBC (60 byte tx packet)
#     msbc-alt1         USB adapters with mSBC in ALT1 setting (24 byte tx packet)
#     msbc-alt1-rtl     Realtek USB adapters with mSBC in ALT1 setting (24 byte tx packet)
#     hw-volume         AVRCP and HSP/HFP hardware volume support
#     hw-volume-mic     Functional HSP/HFP microphone volume support
#     sbc-xq            "nonstandard" SBC codec setting with better sound quality
#
# Features are disabled with the key "no-features" whose value is an
# array of strings in the match rule.
