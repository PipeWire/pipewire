PipeWire 0.3.0

This is the first release of the 0.3 version. It consists of a
major rewrite and is not API or ABI compatible with the 0.2
branch.



Older versions:


PipeWire 0.2.7

This is mostly a bugfix release and is API/ABI compatible with
previous 0.2 versions.

Work is ongoing in the work branch that features a completely new
scheduling method that will enable audio support. Some of these
API changes are backported in this branch.

- Add support for alsa-lib 1.1.9 which changed the include path
- Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
- deviceprovider: fix probing without starting
- add sentinel to some functions
- compiler fixes for musl
- Revert object tree permission checks that broke things, this is
  probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
  be removed later)


PipeWire 0.2.6

- Improve error checking for threads
- Fix some memory and fd leaks
- Fix compilation with C++ compilers and clang
- DISABLE_RTKIT should now not try to use dbus at all
- Camera Portal fixes:
	- add Camera media.role
	- Rename module-flatpak to module-portal
	- Use the portal permissions store for camera checks
- Actually use the passed fd in pipewiresrc
- Make properties with "pipewire." prefix read-only
- Add security label to client object
- Enforce link permissions
- Permissions of objects are now combined with parent permissions
- Remove libv4l2 dependency, it is not used
- Improve format negotiation in autolink #146
- Try to avoid list corruption with event emmission #143
- Fix destroy of client-node memory corruption
- Various small improvements

PipeWire 0.2.5

- build fixes for systemd
- Add cursor and bitmap metadata. This can be used to send a cursor
  sprite with the video stream.
- permissions were set too strict for non-flatpak clients
- Fix crash in loop caused by thread unsafe hook emission
- Add more error checking for thread-loop
- Small cleanups and bugfixes

PipeWire 0.2.4

- Install man pages in right directory
- Add systemd socket activation
- Various memory leak and corruption fixes in properties, dbus and
  buffer mmaped memory.
- Fix v4l2 crash on unplug
- improve stream cleanup

PipeWire 0.2.3

- Fix deviceprovider caps introspection
- Refcounting fixes in pipewiresrc
- Remove clock interpolation from stream
- Improve clock in gstreamer elements
- Remove spalib
- Fix crash with pw_map
- Add version number to hook list
- Improve driver mode in gstreamer elements

PipeWire 0.2.2

- Increment API version and .so version

PipeWire 0.2.1

- Various fixes to memory handling
- Fixes for shutdown
- v4l2 fix enumeration of frame intervals
- Make the daemon stop when the setup commands fail
- Improve safety of hooks
- Update stream API to more future proof version
- Add more options to stream API such as scheduling in the
  main thread and automatic mapping of buffers
- Add version file and macros to check compile time and
  runtime versions of pipewire
- Future proof some structs


PipeWire 0.1.9

- Various build fixes
- Do more permission checks
- Add support for doing async connections. This can be used to
  make connections through the portal later.
- Fix device creation from the GStreamer device monitor
- v4l2 experiment with controls
- move rtkit to a module to avoid dbus dependency
- use dmabuf allocator in gstreamer elements

  idea is to make a replacement jack client library that talks
  pipewire directly instead of trying to emulate a jack server.
