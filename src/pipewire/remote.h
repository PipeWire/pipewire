/** \page page_remote_api Remote API
 *
 * \section sec_remote_api_overview Overview
 *
 * The remote API allows you to connect to a remote PipeWire instance
 * and perform actions on the PipeWire graph. This includes
 *
 * \li introspecting the objects on the instance
 * \li Creating nodes
 * \li Linking nodes on their ports
 * \li providing media to the server for playback or consumption
 * \li retrieving media from the remote instance
 *
 * \section sec_remote_api_loop Event Loop Abstraction
 *
 * Most API is asynchronous and based around an event loop. Methods will
 * start an operation which will cause a state change of the \ref pw_remote
 * object. Connect to the state_changed event to be notified of these
 * state changes.
 *
 * The most convenient way to deal with the asynchronous calls is probably
 * with the thread loop (See \subpage page_thread_loop for more details).
 *
 * \subsection ssec_remote_api_proxy Proxy
 *
 * Proxies are local representations of remote resources. They
 * allow communication between local and remote objects.
 *
 * The \ref pw_remote maintains a list of all proxies, including a core
 * proxy that is used to get access to other proxy objects.
 *
 * See also \subpage page_proxy
 *
 * \section sec_remote_api_remote Remote
 *
 * \subsection ssec_remote_create Create
 *
 * To create a new remote use pw_remote_new(). You will
 * need to pass a local \ref pw_core implementation for event and
 * data loop.
 *
 * A typical loop would be created with pw_thread_loop_new() but
 * other implementation are possible.
 *
 * You will also need to pass properties for the remote. Use
 * pw_fill_remote_properties() to get a default set of properties.
 *
 * After creating the remote, you can track the state of the remote
 * by listening for the state_changed event.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_remote_api_remote_connect Connecting
 *
 * A remote must be connected before any operation can be issued.
 * Calling pw_remote_connect() will initiate the connection procedure.
 *
 * When connecting, the remote will automatically create a core
 * proxy to get access to the registry proxy and types.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_remote_api_remote_registry Registry
 *
 * \subpage page_registry
 *
 *
 * \subsection ssec_remote_api_remote_disconnect Disconnect
 *
 * Use pw_remote_disconnect() to disconnect from the remote.
