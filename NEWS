PipeWire 0.3.7

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
  code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
  all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
  mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
  be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
  in how it presents and manages devices.
  Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
  and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
  it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
  compatibility layer for those who want to try.

- Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
  pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
  the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
  screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
  still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
  elements can now also share a connection between them.

- Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
  and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
  fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.

- Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
  where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
  memory.

- Support for passive links is added again. These are links
  that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
  This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
  to suspend as a group when not in use.

- Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
  the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
  to how links and node states were handled. More work is
  needed to implement more use cases.

- Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
  was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
  in reuse of the wrong memory.

- Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.

- Improved error handling in the session manager.

- Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
  sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
  to the default device. Changing the default device will
  move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
  respect the default source/sinks.

- Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
  a stream and the session manager will move streams when
  the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
  implement the move_stream feature.

- Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
  has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
  apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
  objects. Security related properties are made read-only
  now. Different access modules can now coexist.

- The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
   1) a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
   2) a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.

  jack applications with the right library path.


PipeWire 0.3.2

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- build fixes
- Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
  possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
  and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
  format.
- Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
- Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
  to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
  negotiate.
- Fix JACK midi output.
- Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
  AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
- Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
  shader.
- Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
  processing and use the values from the processing
  context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
- Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
  config file.
- Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
  cause the server to leak all buffers.
- Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
- Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
- Try to select higher quality formats first when
  negotiating a format with an audio device.
- Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.

  do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
  pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
  default and has options to select a different server.
- Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
  samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.


PipeWire 0.3.1

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
  sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
  Only enable this for the jack library for now.
- Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
  signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
  the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
- Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
- improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
  warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
  started the operation or is the owner of the object.
- pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
  in verbose mode
- fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
- Fix and update some examples
- jack: check arguments and don't crash when invalid
- Fix buffer memory upload.
- jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
  install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
  handling.
- fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
- add support for control ports in pw_filter
- fix cleanup of the metadata module
- improve param enumeration.
- Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
- Add create-object command in the config file to create
  object from a factory.
- Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
  nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
- Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
  about a boolean.
- pulseaudio: improve compatibility


PipeWire 0.3.0

The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the developement of
PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
layer with comparable performance to JACK2.

The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
developement files and runtime paths are versioned so that
future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
exising applications.

PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
expected that future version will either switch to a more
flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
configuration options of the example session manager.

PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.

PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
to be somewhat problematic for now.

run correctly in distros.

- Install session manager, fix path to find the session manager
- Fix alsa buffer reuse
- Small fixes for crasher bugs
- Implement pw_core_set_paused() to suspend/resume even
  processing. This can be used when using multiple connections
  to a daemon and one needs to pause one connection until the
  other one completes an action. Used by session managers.
- Improve old version check


PipeWire 0.2.90

This is the first pre-release of the 0.3 version. It consists of a
major rewrite and is not API or ABI compatible with the 0.2
branch.


PipeWire 0.2.7

This is mostly a bugfix release and is API/ABI compatible with
previous 0.2 versions.

scheduling method that will enable audio support. Some of these
API changes are backported in this branch.

- Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
- deviceprovider: fix probing without starting

  probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
  be removed later)
