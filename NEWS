# PipeWire 0.3.48 (2022-03-03)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix IEC958 passthrough again.
  - Fix pulse-server crashes when playing a sample.
  - Support for more a more advanced upmixing algorithm.
  - filter-chain now supports arbitrary many ports.
  - Fix multichannel support in WINE. (with new WirePlumber).
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - The work queue is now created in the context so we can fail early and
    avoid further error checking in various places.
  - Fix a potential use after free with threaded loops.
  - The protocol now has a message footer. This is used to pass around
    global state such as the last registered object serial number. This can
    be used to detect when a client tries to bind to old (but reused)
    object ids. This avoids some races in the session manager but also
    when binding objects.
  - The zero-denormals CPU flag is now not touched anymore unless explicitly
    selected by the user. Denormals are avoided in filter-chain now in
    software. If the zero-denormals are now only configured in the data
    thread. This should fix issues with luajit. (#2160)
  - Configuration parsing will not actually fail on errors.
  - pw-top now correctly clips unicode characters.
  - Many places now use a dynamic POD builder to support arbitrary large
    property sets.
  - pw-stream now support PropInfo parameters so that they can announce
    custom properties.
  - Serial number are now also set on metadata and session-manager objects.

## SPA
  - audioadapter is now smarter when trying to fixate the format. It will
    use the PortConfig format to fill in any wildcards. This results in
    the least amount of conversions when the stream can handle it. It also
    is part of a fix (also requires a session manager fix) for WINE
    multichannel support. (#876).
  - Fix 5.1 to 2 channels mixing. It was using the volume of the stereo
    pair on all channels.
  - Fix some weird volume issues when a source is capturing and
    channelmixing.
  - Add stereo to 7.1 upmixing.
  - The channelmix parameters can be changed at runtime now.
  - Many improvements to the upmixing algorithms. Rear channels are now
    constructed from the ambient sound and can have delay and phase shift
    applied to them to improve spacialization. The stereo channels can
    be filtered so that the dialog is more concentrated in the center
    channel. (#861)

## modules
  - Module X11 bell received cleanups and improvements.
  - The module now has a private method to schedule unload later. This
    simplifies cleanup in many modules.
  - module-filter-chain now handles arbitrary many ports and control
    ports. (#2179)
  - Fix a bug in RAOP where it was reading from the wrong port. (#2183)

## pulse-server
  - Nodes with the DONT_MOVE property should fail with -EINVAL when
    they are moved.
  - Fix a segfault when playing a sample. (#2151)
  - The _FIX flags in pulse-server also now ignore the configured
    sample format, just like pulseaudio does. (#876)
  - Fix IEC958 passthrough again. It got accidentally broken since
    0.3.45 with a fix for another issue. (#1442)
  - Fix module-null-sink device.description. (#2166)

## Bluetooth
  - Don't try to connect HSP/HFP when no backend is available.


Older versions:


# PipeWire 0.3.47 (2022-02-18)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

This is a quick emergency release to fix some severe
problems with the previous release.

## Highlights
  - Fixes a bug in pulse-server that caused cached notifications
    to play multiple times. (#2142)
  - Removed check and warnings to catch leaked listeners on the
    proxy. This might access invalid memory and cause infinite
    loops in older wireplumber.

# PipeWire 0.3.46 (2022-02-17)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fix a critical bug in pipewire-pulse buffer size handling that made some
    apps (MuseScore, ... ) stutter.
  - Fix a critical bug where devices would not show when the kernel was
    compiled without VERBOSE_PROCSFS.
  - JACK clients will now use lock-quantum by default. This makes sure that
    all dynamic quantum changes are disabled while a JACK app is running.
    The only way to force a quantum chance is through a JACK app or with
    the metadata.
  - Almost all limits on number of ports, clients and nodes are removed.
  - A Dummy fallback sink is now automatically created when there are no
    other sinks. This avoids stalling browsers.
  - Sound sharing with Zoom should work better. A new WirePlumber release
    might be required.
  - Many more fixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Update docs with new config overrides.
  - The rule matching logic was moved to config and code is now shared with
    pulse-server and JACK.
  - Add new Romanian translation.
  - When a quantum is forced with metadata, any node that asked to lock-quantum
    is ignored so that the quantum change can happen.
  - Fix a bug where a mixer was removed twice, leading to potential memory
    corruption.
  - The port limits on nodes and filters are now removed. Some code was
    simplified.
  - Fix a potential leak because listeners where removed while they could be
    emitted.
  - Improve context.exec and avoid zombie processes.

## Modules
  - The RAOP module now has a default latency of 2 seconds, like PulseAudio.
  - The echo-cancel module now uses the plugin loader to load the backends.
    This makes it possible to add custom, out of tree, echo cancel plugins.

## Tools
  - Improve help of pw-link.
  - Output to stdout and error to stderr. Use setlinebuf for stdout to improve
    piping between apps. (#2110)

## SPA
  - Improve removing sources when dispatching. Also improve performance now
    that a destroy loop can be removed. (#2114)
  - Fix an fd leak in the logger when logging to a file.
  - Improve loop enter/leave checks and support recursive loops.

## pulse-server
  - Clamp various buffer attributes to the max length. Fixes some issues
    with various applications. (#2100)
  - Module properties are now remapped correctly from their pulseaudio variant
    to the PipeWire ones.
  - Fix module index in introspect. Use the right index when loaded from our
    internal modules. (#2101)
  - Improve argument parsing and node.description. (#2086)
  - The sink-index should now be filled in correctly when playing a sample.
    (#2129)
  - module-always-sink is now implemented and loaded by default. (#1838)
  - Add support for loading some modules only once.
  - Module load and unload now does extra sync to make it appear synchronous,
    like in PulseAudio. This improves sounds sharing in Zoom.

## ALSA
  - Fix critial bug where alsa devices would not show when the kernel was
    compiled without VERBOSE_PROCFS.
  - Some corner cases were fixed in the ALSA timing code. When the capture node
    is follower, it will now not try to read too much data and xrun but it will
    instead produce a cycle of silence.
  - Various fixes and improvements to make ALSA devices resync to the driver
    more quickly and accurately.

## JACK
  - Add an option to name the defauld device as `system` to improve
    compatibility with some applications,
  - Use lock-quantum by default. This makes sure that all dynamic quantum
    changes are disabled while a JACK app is running. The only way to force
    a quantum chance is through a JACK app or with the metadata.
  - It is now possible to do IPC calls from the data thread. Note that this
    is a very bad idea but required for compatibility with JACK2.

## GStreamer
  - GStreamer sink will now set a default channelmap to make it possible to 
    remap to the channel layout of the device.

# PipeWire 0.3.45 (2022-02-03)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Zoom, telegram and other apps should be able to play sound again.
  - Implement a better way to force and lock JACK buffersize.
  - Default sink and source names and properties are improved.
  - The config loader can now load and merge fragments in conf.d directories
    for easier user configuration of config files.
  - Many small bug fixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - pw-cli can now also send Commands to nodes. This can be used to Suspend
    a device, for example.
  - The eventfd was removed from loops and invoke is now used to stop the loop,
    this saves an fd.
  - New Alpine CI target to test musl builds, various build fixes.
  - Add force-quantum and force-rate properties.
  - The config loader can now load and merge fragments in conf.d directories.
    (#207)
  - resource error methods can be called without a resource and then just
    log an error message.
  - link-factory can now also work from the config. (#2095)

## modules
  - module-simple-protocol has better argument parsing and can handle
    channelmap now. (#2068) It's also possible to configure latency and
    rate.
  - The native protocol now does extra checks for invalid data. (#2070)

## ALSA
  - TI2902 chips as found in various Behringer cards should have inputs
    again.
  - Better handling of busy devices in udev, retry when the inotify close
    event is emited.

## SPA
  - plugins now handle alignment properly and only expect the max alignment
    required for the CPU. (#2074)

## Bluetooth
  - SBC-XQ is now enabled for the JBL Endurance RUN BT headset.
  - Support for non-hexadecimal XAPL version strings to improve compatibility.
  - Use HCI commands again to probe the adapter msbc capability. This improves
    compatibility with some adapters. (#2030)
  - Set the right startup volume.
  - Better A2DP source idle handling.
  - Fix a timer bug in SCO sink that could cause busy looping.

## pulse-server
  - A playback issue when the tlength > maxlength was fixed. (#2069) This
    affected Zoom and other applications.
  - The STREAM_BUFFER_ATTR command is now implemented.
  - Module names are improved. (#2076)
  - Many small fixes and improvements.
  - Fix a pavucontrol crash with invalid channels. (#1442)

## JACK
  - Use the new force-quantum and force-rate properties in the JACK API to
    switch quantum and ensure it can't change for the lifetime of the JACK
    app. (#2079)

# PipeWire 0.3.44 (2022-01-27)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - It is now possible to run a minimal PipeWire server without a session
    manager, enough to run JACK clients.
  - The maximum buffer size is now configurable and can be larger than
    the previously hardcoded limit of 8192 samples. When using high sample
    rates, the larger buffer size can avoid xruns.
  - The default maximum latency was reduced from 170ms to 42ms. This should
    improve overall latency for application that ask for a large latency,
    such as notifications.
  - Better JACK compatibility. Patchbays should now get less confused about
    ports appearing and disappearing.
  - Fix some bluetooth crashes.
  - Fix some races in ALSA device detection.
  - Many bug fixes and improvements all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - Bump the meson requirement to 0.59.0.
  - pw-top now reports correct times for filter-chain and loopback.
  - max-quantum is now also scaled with the rate. A new quantum-limit
    property was added as a hard limit for the quantum. This makes it
    possible to configure for larger than 8192 buffer sizes. Note
    than many JACK applications have a hardcoded 8192 limit. (#1931)
  - The max-quantum was reduced to 2048, This gives a 42ms default
    latency. (#1908)
  - pw-filter can now return a NULL buffer from _get_dsp_buffer().
  - Add a PIPEWIRE_RATE and PIPEWIRE_QUANTUM env variable to set the
    graph rate and the graph quantum and rate respectively.
  - Fix a potential file descriptor leak in the connection.
  - A new minimal.conf file was added to demonstrate a static setup
    of a daemon that doesn't require a session manager and is able to
    run JACK applicaions.
  - Nice levels are now only changed on the servers, not the clients.
  - Add an option to suspend nodes when idle.
  - Make it possible to avoid quantum and rate changes with
    pw-metadata. This is essential in a locked down system.
  - Handle mixer port errors better and fail to create the link instead
    of silently not working.
  - Nodes that are moved to a driver now have all the linked nodes moved
    as well. This makes it possible to run some graphs without a
    driver, such as paplay -> zita-j2n.
  - pw-cli and pw-dump can now also list objects by name, serial and
    object.path using glob style pattern matching.


## modules
  - filter-chain can now also configure parameters by index.
  - Fix the client name of module-protocol-simple. (#2017)
  - module-rtkit was merged into module-rt. This makes it easier to
    ship a default config that works on more systems by default.
  - module-adapter can now configure the adapter node from the config.
    Previously, this was a task only performed by the session manager.
  - module-metadata can now also create metadata object from the
    config file.
  - The ROC module should now work again. (#2045)
  - An X11-bell module was added to handle X11 bell events. (#1668)
  - filter-chain and loopback modules now have better unique default
    names for the streams, which makes it possible to save and restore
    their volumes independently. (#1983)
  - module-echo-cancel now has properties to control the delay and
    buffer size.

## ALSA
  - The monitor names are now correctly parsed.
  - The default period size for batch devices is limited now to avoid
    large latency.
  - The unused min/max-latency properties were removed.
  - Internal latency is now also configurable with params at runtime.
  - The udev rule for TI2902 was removed because it causes problems.
  - Fix a race where some devices would sometimes be missing. (#2046)
  - Add some more timeouts to work around a race in udev device
    permission changes when switching VTs.

## SPA
  - Fix potential infinite loop in audioconvert.
  - The spa-resample tools can now also use optimized implementations.
  - Fix a potential crash in resampler. (#1994)
  - audioconvert can now also handle F64 formats. (#1990)
  - The channelmixer now does normalization by default to avoid clipping
    when downmixing is active.
  - The channelmixer will now generate LFE channels when the lfe_cutoff
    frequency is set, even when upmix is disabled.
  - The channelmixer will now always generate FC when the target has it.
  - Adapter now reports latency correctly, even after linking the monitor
    ports.
  - Reduce memory usage and preallocated memory in some of the
    audioconvert nodes.
  - Many properties are now exposed in adapter, such as the resample
    quality.
  - The resampler and channelmixer can now be disabled.

## V4L2
  - pw-v4l2 now also works for ffplay. (#2029)
  - Take product names from udev now that the kernel returns a generic
    name.

## JACK
  - The jack pkgconfig file now has the `jack_implementation=pipewire`
    variable to be able to distinguish jack implementations. (#1666)
  - jconvolver now starts correctly again. (#1989)
  - The object.serial is now used for the port_id. This makes it easier
    to track old objects in the cache.
  - Add a dummy jacknet implementation. (#2043)
  - A bug in the port allocation was fixed that would make it impossible
    to allocate ports at some point. (#1714)

## Bluetooth
  - Bluetooth profiles are now saved properly by the session manager.
  - Improved profile detections, increased timeouts for slow devices.
  - Implement HFP call indicator for improved compatibility.
  - Handle the case where bluez does not set the adapter or address
    properties on the device instead of crashing.
  - Improved support for setting the profile from the session manager.

## pulse-server
  - Monitor sources now have the device.class=monitor for better
    compatibility.
  - Behaviour after seeking is improved. The algorithm for requesting
    bytes from the client was simplified and improved. (#1981)
  - module-ladspa-sink implements the control argument now. (#1987)
  - A potential memory leak in the message queue was fixed. (#1840)
  - Use the object.serial for the pulseaudio object index. The index is
    not supposed to be reused and this would cause problems with some
    clients.
  - Servers should now again be able to listen in IPv4. (#2047)
  - module-x11-bell was added. (#1668)
  - There is now support for per-application quirks and properties in
    the pipewire-pulse.conf file. Per-application latency and buffering
    properties can also be configured.
  - Fix a regression in telegram sounds not playing.

# PipeWire 0.3.43 (2022-01-05)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Flatpak apps such as Ardour can now remove links again.
  - Many fixes to pulse-server. Memory usage should be improved. Some
    crashes are fixed. Underrun handling should work better. Better
    compatibility with GStreamer based applications after seeking.
  - Many of the samplerate and quantum changes bugs in previous releases
    were fixed. This fixes some issues where the microphone would fail
    to work.
  - Many more small fixes and improvements all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - Quantum and rate changes are now applied immediately when the driver
    is idle. This avoids setting the driver in the previous samplerate.
    (#1913)
  - Object destruction now does not need write permissions anymore. This
    restriction needs some more work. (#1920)
  - When we reposition, start a sync operation. This fixes a problem
    in Ardour when seeking. (#1907)
  - Require meson 0.56.0
  - Make the align property in BUFFER_PARAM optional. We now only set this
    if the plugin has specific requirements and we default to the CPU
    largest alignment requirement.
  - pw-record will now also list monitors and streams as possible targets.

## modules
  - Improve LV2 plugin support in filter-chain. Add support for Worker and
    Options.
  - The loopback module now has a unique media.name to make it possible
    for the session manager to restore unique volume settings.

## SPA
  - Improve sample rate for EAC3 streams, some clients scale it while
    others don't so use some heuristics to make things work better.
    (#1902)
  - Allocate ports dynamically in audioconvert. This avoids using larger
    memory blocks of preallocated memory that confuses the allocator.
    (#1840)

## ALSA
  - Merge the latest pulseaudio UCM improvements. (#1849)
  - Fixes for selecting the sample rate. (#1892)
  - Improve latency on USB devices by scaling the period size based on
    the desired quantum when the device is opened.
  - Add api.alsa.period-num to configure the amount of periods to use
    in the device. Some devices have lower latency when a small value
    is forced. (#1473)
  - Allow multi-rate by default. In previous versions cards could only
    be opened in one samplerate to avoid bugs in pre 5.16 kernels. This
    however caused other problems so the default was removed.
  - Fix a bug where a card was not freed correctly.
  - Fix a bug in the alsa boundary check that could hang the alsa-plugin
    for a long time.
  - The ALSA plugin now has a parameter to configure the allowed
    samplerates.

## JACK
  - Improve handling of monitor nodes.

## Bluetooth
  - Codecs now have a priority. This should improve codec selection.

## pulse-server
  - The stream FIX_ flags are now implemented. (#1912)
  - Improve flushing and draining behaviour. Short samples will now
    play correctly. (#1549)
  - Fix a crash when enumerating the formats. (#1928)
  - Track quantum changes and update the amount of required buffering
    accordingly. This improves forced quantum handling. (#1930)
  - Improve handling of channels > 32.
  - Handle the case where a module is destroyed before it could be
    completely loaded.
  - Fixes some issues when samples were removed while they were playing.
    (#1953)
  - Fix some issues in module-zeroconf-publish.
  - Fix some memory leaks in module-roc.
  - Add command access control. This avoids execution of commands without
    proper authentication.

# PipeWire 0.3.42 (2021-12-16)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

This is a quick emergency release to fix some severe
problems with the previous release.

## Highlights
  - Fixes a bug in pulse-server underrun handling that broke qemu
    and orca.
  - A fix was added to pulse-server to handle quantum changes
    gracefully.
  - Fix module-echo-cancel again.
  - Fix a bug where the bluetooth headset capture was producing
    noise.


# PipeWire 0.3.41 (2021-12-13)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Improved compatibility for flatpaks. Flatpaks with newer PipeWire
    version can connect to an older server in all cases.
  - A new RAOP module was added to stream to Apple Airplay devices.
  - OBS can now capture from the monitor devices again when using
    WirePlumber.
  - Improved JACK compatibility. Improved stability in Carla and Ardour
    when changing buffer size. Improved latency calculations and
    playback latency in Ardour.
  - Improved pulse-server handling of underruns and buffer size changes.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - The systemd service files now have better names.
  - client.access permission checks are improved.
  - Fix some memory leaks in error paths.
  - Objects now have a global serial number that is unique for the
    lifetime of the server.
  - Make clock.rate, clock.allowed-rates and clock.quantum
    runtime tunable parameters with the settings metadata.
  - Add some additional memory checks in client-node to avoid
    sending invalid memory to clients. (#1859)
  - Improve buffer memory allocation. If one of the nodes is a
    remote node, ensure we only use memory that can be shared.
  - Version checks when binding to objects is removed. This means
    that newer clients can now bind to older servers, which is
    a typical case for a flatpak.
  - A bug in the latency calculations was fixed where it would in
    some cases report the wrong minumum latency.

## modules
  - module-echo-cancel has voice-detection enabled now.
  - module-raop-sink and module-raop-discover to stream audio to
    an Apple Airplay device.
  - module-filter-chain now has preliminary support for LV2
    plugins.

## SPA
  - The audio resampler now has improved buffer size calculations.
    In some cases it was too small and would cause distortions.
  - More checks are done when doing volume changes so that the
    channelmap is correct.
  - Audioadapter now exposes most config options with params so that
    they can be adjusted at runtime.
  - The resampler can now calculate the expected input buffer size
    before receiving the first buffer, which avoids some confusion
    when starting streams.
  - Support was added for some 10bit video formats.
  - MONO channel handling was improved.
  - Most plugins now set a clock name and this is configurable where
    it makes sense. The clock.system.monotonic clock name is used
    for most plugins that use the system clock for timing.

## pulse-server
  - implement module-raop-discover
  - Use STREAM_CAPTURE_SINK property when capturing from a monitor
    source to better inform the session manager. This fixes some
    issues where OBS would capture from the microphone instead of
    the output monitor.
  - Limit the amount of cache messages to 16MB and don't add large
    memory blocks to the cache. This should fix some excessive
    memory usage that people reported.
  - Fix a potential memory leak when cleaning up a client.
  - Do some additional checks to avoid buffer overruns.
  - Improve recovery from underruns better. (#1857) This improves
    seeking in gnome-music.
  - Improve recovery when the quantum is forced larger that the
    stream configured latency.
  - The prebuf state is now handled correctly.

## JACK
  - A per type object cache is now implemented. This ensures that
    port objects remain valid for a longer time because many
    JACK applications inspect objects after they are destroyed.
    This improves catia/carla compatibility.
  - Recompute the latencies when the buffer-size changes. Fix some
    cases where we would end up with negative latencies.
  - Handle regcomp errors to avoid some crashes later.
  - Latency calculations are improved a lot.
  - More care is taken to not call a process callback while a buffer
    size change is pending. This fixes some crashes in Carla, which
    expect that all clients are paused when one handles the buffersize
    callback.
  - Loopback links to a client are now handled correctly and without
    latency. This fixes playback latency in ardour6 (#1839)

## ALSA
  - ALSA devices now keep track of the samplerate of the card and
    ensure that all PCM use the same rate. This is a workaround for
    a kernel bug that is fixed in 5.16.
  - Refactor the ALSA plugin a little.
  - The ALSA plugin now reports correct delay for a capture PCM. (#1697)
  - The ALSA nodes now expose all config options with params that can be
    changed at runtime.
  - The ALSA node has a configurable clock name. Adaptive resampling to
    match clock rates is avoided when the driver has the same clock
    name as the ALSA node. This can be used to link alsa devices together
    with a word clock.

# PipeWire 0.3.40 (2021-11-11)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Producers and consumers can now incrementally negotiate a format
    by narrowing down the options. This can be used to select an optimal
    combination of format and modifiers.
  - Driver nodes such as the consumer of a headless compositor can now
    throttle the speed based on a new trigger_done event.
  - Headless compositors can now signal a damage event to consumers
    to start the processing of the graph.
  - Compatibility improvements in JACK.
  - Draining and resuming is now working correctly in pulse and alsa.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Many BSD fixes.
  - clang compilation fixes.
  - Fix map implementation on big-endian machines.
  - Improve tracking of param changes in pw-stream.
  - Add support for renegotiation. With this change, producer and
    consumer can incrementally renegotiate a format until it is fixed.
    This will be used to do complex negotiation of DRM modifiers.
    (#1732).
  - Add a trigger-done event in the stream. This can be used to know
    when processing of the complete graph has finished after issuing
    a trigger_process() and it can be used to throttle processing.
  - Add a RequestProcess node event and command. This can be used by
    non-driver nodes to suggest to a driver to start processing. One
    case is where a compositor can emit this event as a result of a
    screen update to let the headless compositor start an update.
  - Fix zeroconf sample format.
  - pw-mon outputs to stderr now and has colors.

## SPA
  - Fix compilation on ppc and armv7.
  - Fix port type check for ALSA seq midi ports so that they are not
    falsely listed as hardware.
  - Fix crash when running SSE code on unsupported HW. (#1775)
  - The libcamera plugin was rewritten. It now supports hotplug,
    format enumeration and an easier to read codebase.
  - Fix compatibility some more for cards with 64 channels.

## pulse-server
  - Flush data in pause in combine-sink to avoid stray audio fragments.
  - Fix a race where not all objects were removed correctly.
  - The latency calculations and setup was improved to more closely
    match pulseaudio behaviour. PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC should now resemble
    pulseaudio more closely. (#1769)
  - The drained reply is now sent only once and new data will be
    accepted once the drain completes.
  - Fix a potential crasher bug where the stream started processing
    before the setup was completed.
  - The server will now drop the client connections when the pipewire
    connection is lost.

## JACK
  - Rework the jack_port_get_buffer() method to return the same memory
    when called multiple times during the process() callback. This makes
    things work on a new Hydrogen. (#1748)
  - Add an option to disable showing the monitor ports.
  - JACK ports are now sorted per node/client and port_id. This should
    more closely match JACK behaviour and avoid random port order.
    (#1780)

## v4l2
  - Fix v4l2 LD_PRELOAD script.
  - Make sure we destroy the proxy when the global is destroyed.

## ALSA
  - _prepare should exit the draining state. (#1467)
  - Fix the precision of the _delay function by taking into account
    the amount of queued samples are the correct samplerate.


# PipeWire 0.3.39 (2021-10-21)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with previous
0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - media-session is now moved into a separate module to speed up its
    deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
  - There is now an LD_PRELOAD v4l2 emulation library to run some existing
    v4l2 applications on top of PipeWire.
  - Filter-chains should now flush out remaining samples when paused. There
    is now also the option to let a filter-chain drain so that long filters
    such as reverbs can fade out properly.
  - Stability and compatibility improvements in JACK apps.
  - Better Bluetooth compatibility with more devices.
  - libcamera plugin improvements.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements all over the map.


## PipeWire
  - Fix compilation on ARM.
  - Log topics are added to most modules.
  - Documentation updates. Many improvements to the layout. Reorganisation
    of the modules and groups.
  - Share a work queue for all links and nodes. This removes the need for
    a separate eventfd per link and per node.
  - Catch errors in the map implementation.
  - Add option to compile without dbus support.
  - Fix biquad frequency. It was using the wrong sample rate.
  - Fix a potential crash when destroying nodes, in some cases the node
    would not be deactivated properly.
  - Add some more helpers for dealing with properties and their values.
  - Implement flush and reset on virtual sinks/sources.
  - Make it possible to let virtual sinks/filter-chains run and drain
    after being idle.
  - Fix a bug where the quantum could exceed the maximum because it was
    scaled with the sample rate.
  - Fix channel_map parsing in module-zeroconf-discover so that the remote
    channel map is used.
  - pw-stream errors emitted on the proxy are reported but not fatal
    any more. They are usually used by the session manager to signal status
    to the client but otherwise does not really cause an error on the
    client.
  - Links now also store the output and input node id in the global
    properties so that applications can parse and use them regardless of
    how the link was made. (#1723)
  - pw-stream and pw-filter now have an event to notify commands.
  - The echo-cancel module can now operate on larger quantums.
  - pw-cat now uses the right metadata to find the default devices in
    --list-targets.

## media-session
  - Don't try to remix unpositioned streams when linking. This ensures
    that linking to Pro-Audio nodes does not remix the stream channels
    but links them as they are, one by one.
  - media-session is now moved to a separate module to accelerate its
    deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.

## SPA
  - Many libcamera improvements, handle MemFd buffers, handle errors
    gracefully.
  - Small improvements to make interface fall-backs easier to implement.
  - Add support to enable flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero to avoid
    high CPU usage when dealing with denormals.
  - AUX13 channels are no longer reported as AUX12. (#1727)
  - Devices with more than 32 channels in Pro-Audio mode now only
    uses AUX channels.
  - Improve windowing function of the resampler to reduce aliasing and
    improve the quality.

## JACK
  - Port connect callbacks will not only be emitted after the port
    has negotiated buffers, which improves compatibility with
    applications that try to use the port right after the callback
    (jack_midi_latency_test).
  - Fix crash when midi ports were removed and being monitored, like
    in Ardour.

## pulse-server
  - The pulse tunnel will now use the specified format/rate/channels.
  - Improve lookup of default source and fall back to the monitors when
    no sources are available.
  - Mark some nodes as network nodes so that we can set the NETWORK flag
    correctly.

## GStreamer
  - The GStreamer element not releases the buffers in the stream again in
    all cases so that they can be reused by other streams.

## v4l2
  - Add a v4l2 LD_PRELOAD library to emulate v4l2 system calls on top of
    PipeWire. This is tested with firefox and GStreamer and is known to
    not work with Chrome.

## Bluetooth
  - AAC compatibility improvements.
  - Disable hardware volume for "Tribit MAXSound Plus" and
    "SoundCore mini".
  - Add quirk to disable faststream. Disable faststream on "FiiO BTR3".
  - Add a dummy AVRCP player to improve compatibility with some devices.


# PipeWire 0.3.38 (2021-09-30)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Topic based logging was added to improve debugging.
  - An off-by-one error was fixed in the audio resampler that could
    cause distortion when downsampling.
  - Various bluetooth compatibility improvements.
  - More fixes and improvements.

## PipeWire
  - module-pulse-tunnel now has better default latency to make it work
    better in more cases. There is also an option to configure the
    desired latency.
  - pw-cli now has readline support.
  - Topic based logging was added. Log lines can now be filtered by
    topic using wildcards. This should improve debugging.
  - The systemd service files should now have better descriptions.
  - Fix a crash in module-zeroconf-discover when unloading.
  - Fix a crash in filter-chain when using unaligned memory.

## ALSA
  - Sync the udev rules and profiles with pulseaudio.
  - Fix a memory leak.

## SPA plugins
  - An off-by-one error was fixed in the resampler that could cause
    distortion when downsampling. (#1646)

## Bluetooth
  - Avoid probing the native backend because it might block for DBus
    activation. This fixes some long startup times.
  - Fix the kernel version check, 5.14.x kernels should also support
    mSBC.
  - Fix FastStream microphone support in more cases.
  - Add workaround for Intel AX200.
  - SCO sink should now also work in follower mode.

## PulseAudio server
  - Make the service file require a session manager.


# PipeWire 0.3.37 (2021-09-23)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Capture and playback is now avoided even more on unavailable
    devices. This should fix some issues where an unusable microphone
    was selected by default. It should now also again be possible
    to select an unavailable device as the default.
  - Native DSD audio playback is now supported. pw-cat can now also
    play DSF files with the -d option.
  - JACK stability improvements with buffer-size and samplerate
    changes in some apps.
  - Many cleanups and bugfixes all over the place.

## PipeWire
  - pw-metadata -d does not cause an infinite loop anymore. (#1622)
  - Increase some plugin buffer sizes to fix some issues with many
    channels. (#1620)
  - Protect the global plugin list with a lock. Make sure pw_init()
    is locked. Fixes some issues with concurrent ALSA plugin usage.

## media-session
  - Unavailable devices can be set as the default again. (#1624)
  - Do a better check if a device has available routes and avoid
    selecting devices with unavailable routes as default.
  - Media-session was moved to its own directory. It used to live
    in examples but it is past the example stage and it interferes
    with the build options for the real examples.

## Bluetooth
  - The hardware quirk database is now loaded by the plugin instead of
    the session manager. This makes it also work with wireplumber.

## ALSA
  - The ALSA mixer now handles device removal much better. (#1627)

## libcamera
  - Many fixes and improvement to the libcamera plugin. (#1513)

## pulse-server
  - Improve compatibility with pulseaudio module arguments.
  - Parse channel_map arguments in module-loopback. (#1486)

## JACK
  - Delay emitting the samplerate and buffersize callbacks until the
    client is active. This fixes some crashes with Carla and other
    JACK apps.

# PipeWire 0.3.36 (2021-09-16)

This is a quick bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - A quick update with mostly only bugfixes and small improvements.
  - Capture and playback is now avoided on unavailable devices. This
    should fix some issues where an unusable microphone was selected
    by default.
  - MIDI output should not stop randomly now.
  - The GStreamer elements are much improved, cheese should work
    a lot better now.
  - Virtual sinks and sources should now always show up immediately.
  - JACK processing is now delayed until buffersize and samplerate
    are emitted. This should improve stability of many JACK apps.
  - JACK transport sync is now implemented correctly so that preroll
    in bitwig works.

## PipeWire
  - The module dir environment variable can now contain multiple paths.
  - Documentation now contains dot graphs of dependencies. (#1585)
  - config min/max/default quantum values are now scaled with the
    samplerate.
  - A potential crash was fixed where destroyed memory was still used
    by a node. This could cause crashes in cheese.

## pipewire-media-session
  - Only allow passthrough for passthrough formats (S/PDIF) for
    now. (#1587)
  - Improve bluetooth profile autoswitch.
  - Don't try to route audio to nodes with unavailable routes.

## ALSA
  - Pass the right AES bits to the alsa device when opening an
    S/PDIF stream.
  - Fix a bug in the MIDI bridge port management logic. When a port
    was added and immediately removed, output would stop.

## GStreamer
  - The GStreamer source now handles the flushing state correctly.
  - All blocking operations now have a 30 seconds timeout, to avoid
    infinite locks.

## Plugins
  - V4l2 Device formats and controls are now passed on the node, just
    like with audio devices.
  - audioconvert now also exposes the softMute property.

## JACK
  - Improve stability when changing buffer size and sample rate
    dynamically by pausing the processing until the application has
    handled the callback.
  - Improve handling of timebase master. When the master was moved to
    another driver, it did not attempt to become a new timebase
    master on the new driver. (#1589)
  - Implement transport sync to make preroll in bitwig work. (#1589)

## pulse-server
  - Fix an issue where virtual sinks/sources would not show up
    immediately. (#1588)


# PipeWire 0.3.35 (2021-09-09)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - S/PDIF passthrough over optical or HDMI is now implemented.
  - Some critical fixes to MIDI, draining of streams and various
    modules.
  - skypeforlinux should work better now after adding it to the
    quirks database.
  - Bluetooth codecs are now in separate plugins to make it easier
    to ship them.

## PipeWire
  - Drain was fixed in pw-stream. In some cases it would not clear
    the drain state correctly. Fixes the issue where speaker-test would
    only play one channel.
  - Loopback connections to a driver will now activate the driver. This
    fixes an issue where MIDI connections between devices or some
    applications (puredata) would not get any MIDI messages. (#1559)
  - The audiomixer can now mix more formats. Together with the passthrough
    improvements this can be used to avoid conversions to/from the DSP
    format in some cases.
  - Make sure we idle drivers when removing a node from it in all cases.
    JACK clients could keep a driver node busy.
  - Add new methods to accumulate object info. The old one was difficult
    to use when applications need to accumulate multiple changes.
  - A new interface to load modules has been added. Plugins can use this
    to ask the host (PipeWire) to load spa plugins.
  - Increase param buffer size to handle larger params. Nodes with a large
    number of channels would sometimes not have properties. (#1574)
  - Concurrent link negotiation that caused some links to not work,
    is now avoided. This fixes monitor ports in Ardour6.
  - Small tweaks to how the quantum and rate are handled when nodes move
    between drivers. Make node.lock-quantum work with node.latency

## PipeWire modules
  - The convolver plugin in filter-chain has been optimized some more.
  - The echo-cancel stream properties were improved so that it actually
    can remember the streams it links to. (#1557)
  - module-pulse-tunnel had the buffer attributes wrong and would cause
    high latency with older pulseaudio servers. (#1434)
  - module-roc had the properties configured wrongly, which would cause
    it to not work at all in most cases. (#1538)
  - There is now an example of a 7.1 virtual surround sink using the
    hesuvi impulse responses.
  - The convolver now supports dirac pulses as the IR.

## ALSA
  - UCM config is now cached per device, using up less memory. It also
    temporarily works around a problem in alsa-lib that is now being
    patched and rolled out. Should stop devices from disappearing when
    logging out and back in. (#1553)
  - Fix the MIDI clock rate matching. It was too sensitive to small
    changes and would spiral out of control and break MIDI rather
    quickly.

## pipewire-media-session
  - The media session can now save and restore IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs
    for the sinks.
  - Passthrough of IEC958 (S/PDIF) content is now possible. If the client
    and the sink contain a compatible set of codecs, an exclusive
    connection can be made between client and sink to pass the encoded
    S/PDIF content directly to the device.
  - Use new introspection info update methods to suspend nodes in all
    cases. Sometimes, nodes would fail to suspend because the state info
    was not evaluated.
  - The media session can now work in non-DSP mode, which will try to
    avoid any audio conversions between client and device when possible.
    But, this will also disable compatibility with JACK applications.

## Bluetooth
  - Bluetooth codecs are now compiled into separate plugins which are
    dynamically loaded. This makes it possible to change the plugin
    implementation or ship plugins separately without having to recompile
    the bluetooth module.

## PulseAudio server
  - Delay stream create reply until the stream is linked to a sink/source.
  - The device-restore extension is now implemented. This makes it possible
    to configure the IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs supported by the sink with
    pavucontrol.
  - skypeforlinux now uses the same quirks as teams to make the sinks
    show up in all cases. This fixes the issue of not being able to hear
    the remote end in skypeforlinux.

## JACK
  - Improve catia and carla compatibility by caching objects a little longer
    after being removed. (#1531)
  - JACK ports now notify the negotiated format correctly.
  - A potential deadlock was fixed when multiple threads would perform a
    call that would require a roundtrip.
  - Improve bufsize callback, it should not be called right after doing
    activate() but only when the buffersize changes later.
  - Add tweak to disable the process lock. Some older apps might not
    expect it. (#1576)

## Docs
  - man pages are now generated with rst2man.
  - DMA-BUF docs were updated.
  - Documentation updates.


# PipeWire 0.3.34 (2021-08-26)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.


## Highlights
  - Fixes some critical issues with previous release. Such as
    devices not showing up and default devices being lost.
  - Support for consumer driver streams to make the producer v-sync
    to the consumer monitor in a headless compositor setup.
  - Improvements to routing of streams.
  - Bluetooth battery status support for head-set profile and
    using Apple extensions. aptX-LL and FastStream codec support
    was added.
  - Internal latency of ALSA devices can now be configured.
  - A fast convolver was added to the filter-chain to implement
    virtual surround sinks or reverbs.

## PipeWire
  - Add support for streams that are driver nodes for the graph.
    This was already possible for source streams but it is now
    also possible for playback streams. This can be used to let
    a producer v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless
    compositor setup. (#1484)
  - State files are now stored in XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME. They will still be loaded from the config home
    if they are not in the new state home, to ease migration.
  - Set a driver on inactive nodes to make transport work in xjadeo.
    (#1491)
  - Fix parsing of filter-chain controls.
  - A new FFT based convolver was added to module-filter-chain. It
    uses a 0-latency 2 stage convolver with small FFT for the head
    and a large FFT for the tail of the convolution. A convolution
    can be used to implement IR based reverbs, HRIR surround sound
    or other convolution based operations. An example HRIR
    virtual surround sound sink has been added as well.
  - module-filter-chain was reworked a bit to support more config
    options for the plugins.
  - Endian conversion and alaw/ulaw formats are now supported for
    streams.
  - pw-cat will now suggest a samplerate for the graph.
  - SPA_PLUGIN_DIR can now search in multiple paths separated with
    a ':'.
  - Passthrough mode has been worked on and has been partially
    merged. S/PDIF definitions have been added and ALSA devices
    updated to report and configure S/PDIF formats. The session
    manager changes to fully configure and enable passthrough mode
    will hopefully be merged next time.
  - Fix a race in pw-stream where it would not always emit the
    right events.

## ALSA
  - Fix volume changed check. It was checking against the wrong
    value and this could cause rounding errors.
  - The ALSA plugin now also uses RT scheduling.
  - Fix the behringer UMC202 usb device id, it was using a generic
    TI chip ID that caused problems.
  - Fix USB devices that don't show up anymore. Use an ALSA
    workaround to fix this. (#1478)
  - Add a rule for the new firmware of Sennheiser GSX 1200.
  - ALSA sink and source can now use ProcessLatency param to configure
    the internal latency. The latencyOffsetNsec property is also
    exposed so that the latency can be adjusted in pavucontrol as
    well.

## media-session
  - Fix a critical issue where the default device was not remembered
    anymore when it was removed.
  - Fix the issue where some apps need to be restarted when nodes go
    away and reappear.
  - Improve routing of streams. Streams that have a specific target
    set will now be moved to the target when it appears instead of
    staying on the fallback.
  - Small memory leak fixes.
  - Try to switch back to the user selected profile after finishing a
    Bluetooth recording.

## Bluetooth
  - Add support for HF indicator 2 battery status.
  - Add support for XAPL battery status.
  - Set the Communication intended role for HFP profile.
  - Enable SBC-XQ by default if not disabled by quirks.
  - Fix some potential crashes due to excessive polling.
  - Add aptx-LL codec and enable duplex for aptx-LL devices.
  - Add FastStream codec. This is a codec that can use a
    duplex SBC channel.

## PulseAudio server
  - Suggests a samplerate for the graph.
  - Support for handling S/PDIF (IEC958) formats was added. This will
    start working when the session manager supports configuring streams
    and nodes in passthrough mode.
  - Be smarter when handling devices without a negotiated format
    yet so that they are visible as well. This makes virtual
    devices show up immediately.

## ALSA plugin
  - Now suggests a samplerate for the graph.

## JACK
  - The jack.pc file can only be generated with meson >= 0.59.0. When
    the jack-devel option is enabled, it will generate an error with
    older meson.
  - Small stability improvements when connecting/disconnecting in
    Ardour.


# PipeWire 0.3.33 (2021-08-05)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Better support for virtual sinks/sources for Pro Audio
    profile.
  - Better DMA-BUF format modifier negotiation.
  - Support multiple sample rates in the graph. Not enabled
    by default yet.
  - Bluetooth can now automatically switch between headset
    and audio profile.
  - Documentation updates.
  - Many improvements and crasher fixes.

## PipeWire
  - Make AUX channels an official channel map, use this for the
    PRO audio profile so that we can name the channels. This
    make it possible to define virtual sources and sinks for
    Pro Audio devices in a more reliable way.
  - Fix scheduling of some virtual sinks/sources. (#1407)
  - Fix potential corruption of ringbuffer because of multiple
    concurrent writers. This might be the cause for many reported
    crashes. (#1451)
  - Don't place sockets in $HOME. (#1443)
  - Improve DMA-BUF negotiation. Add a flag to avoid fixation
    of a property so that producers can negotiate more
    efficiently. This is used to negotiate DMA-BUF modifiers,
    which should make more efficient use of the GPU. (#1084)
  - Add support for multiple sample rates. The graph can switch
    when IDLE to one of the supported rates. Add an option to
    lock the rate as well. This is not enabled by default yet
    because of driver bugs that need to be worked around first.
  - Add node.lock-quantum property that can be used to lock the
    quantum in place.
  - Improve latency reporting in the loopback module.
  - Make new client-node method to send the peer port id to the
    mixer. This can be used to know where the buffers entering the
    mixer are coming from. (#1471)

## Tools
  - pw-top should now also correctly show bluetooth devices. (#1540)

## media-session
  - Handle unset of the default node.
  - Added a module that can switch the bluetooth profile to headset
    profile when a stream wants to record from it.

## JACK
  - Only call the jack callbacks when the client is active. Some
    JACK applications don't expect callbacks before the client is
    active and crash (x42-dpl). (#1461)
  - Emit client unregister event.
  - Add per-client match rules in the config file to set app
    specific configuration and tweaks. (#1456)
  - Use peer_id to implement jack_port_get_buffer() from one of
    our peer ports to get the data before it enters the mixer.
    Makes the capture monitors work in Ardour6.8. (#1471)

## Bluetooth
  - Add some broken kernel versions to the mSBC blocklist
  - Avoid looping and consuming CPU when we can't write to the
    BT socket.
  - Use libfreeaptx instead of libopenaptx.
  - Fix rounding errors in HW volume conversion.

## PulseAudio server
  - implement module-switch-on-connect to emulate pulseaudio
    behaviour of new devices. Some desktop environments expect
    this behaviour and break otherwise.
  - Fix stream cleanup, make sure the stream is stopped before
    destroying it. Might be cause for some of the reported
    crashes.
  - Update message API to use the JSON format.

## Other
  - Many documentation updates.
  - Many cleanups and small improvements.
  - Support the latest libcamera version. (#1435)


# PipeWire 0.3.32 (2021-07-20)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Real-time priority handling for threads was reworked. Freewheeling
    will now drop RT priorities to avoid being killed.
  - Problems with filter chains and echo-cancel being linked in a loop
    was fixed.
  - alsamixer should now be able to see the mixer controls again.
  - JACK has seen some latency reporting improvements that make Ardour
    report latencies correctly.
  - Many bugfixes and improvements.


## PipeWire
  - Fix a bug in the neon audio resampler code.
  - There is now a node.link-group property to relate linked streams.
    this can be used to track the dataflow with coupled streams.
  - Fix a crash when recalculating latency on a destroyed port. (#1371)
  - Filter chains and other modules that create streams can now also
    be added to the daemon config itself. (#1309)
  - Fix some potential deadlocks in timerfd. (#1377)
  - Feedback links are skipped when recalculating latency to avoid
    loops.
  - The dummy driver and null-sink now stop the timerfd when following
    another driver instead of generating useless graph wakeups.
  - rt.limit was increased to 2 seconds. Some applications got killed
    because they run lengthy code in the Real-Time thread. (#1344)
  - Fix s24_32 to float, it was not sign extending properly. (#1393)
  - The performance of the feedback loop check algorithm was improved
    a lot, making complex graphs start much much faster.
  - The zeroconf publish module now doesn't republish nodes every time
    the volume changes. (#1406)
  - A potential memory corruption error has been fixed in the loop
    that could cause random crashes.
  - Mempools can now be created from multiple threads at the same
    time.

## media-session
  - Loops in coupled streams are now avoided. (#1394)
  - Port changes for inactive profiles are ignored now by the
    default-route module. (#1403)

## ALSA
  - Make sure that alibpref is not part of the device node name because
    it is random. (#1362)
  - Fixed an off-by-one that could cause midi events to end up with a
    wrong timestamp and thus being discarded by some apps. (#1395)
  - Fix some memory leaks when destroying a card object.

## JACK
  - Fix some invalid cycle wakeups that could cause JACK application to
    run with a 0 buffer size. (#1386)
  - JACK can now use rtkit to manage realtime priorities on threads.
  - The Real-time priority is dropped when entering freewheel mode to
    make sure we don't get killed when using too much CPU.
  - jack_recompute_total_latencies() is now implemented, fixing the
    latency reporting in Ardour. (#1388)
  - Fix some overflows in time calculations.
  - Ensure frame_rate in position is never 0.
  - Graph callbacks are now emitted as well.

## Bluetooth
  - RTP payload type is now set correctly for aptX, LDAC and SBC, which
    should improve compatibility with devices that care about this.

## PulseAudio server
  - There is now a quirks database to deal with bad clients. The database
    is builtin but can be made external later.
    - Teams is now lied to and told all sink/sources use s16 samples to make
      it show all sinks/sources.
    - Firefox is forced to remove the DONT_MOVE flag on capture streams so
      that you can move firefox streams with other tools.
  - The UNDERFLOW warnings are now made into info log messages to not
    spam the log too much. Many application just let things underrun
    and PulseAudio did not warn about this either. (#910)

## ALSA plugin
  - The alsa plugin now uses the right metadata for finding the default
    source and sink, which makes the volume controls reappear. (#1384)

## Other
  - Cleanups in pulse-server and pipewire.
  - Documentation additions.

# PipeWire 0.3.31 (2021-06-28)

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

## Highlights
  - Fixes for alsa-lib 1.2.5
  - New pulseaudio modules: module-avahi-zeroconf,
    module-pipe-source, module-roc-sink, module-roc-source.
  - JACK has seen massive stability improvements. Locking
    and correctness wrt to callbacks has been reworked. Also
    thread priorities have improved.

    descriptors.
  - Bluetooth now uses a hardware database to disable
    non-working features on listed devices.
  - Scheduling quantum and rate can now be changed dynamically
    with pw-metadata.

## PipeWire
  - Improve cleanup of context in error cases.
  - There is now a pw-test framework for improved unit tests.
  - Improve property serialization to valid JSON.
  - Fix some macros to work with better with coverity.
  - Metadata permissions are checked now. Clients need the
    M permission on an object to be able to set metadata for
    it.
  - The core metadata object will now remove metadata for
    removed objects, the implementor does not need to worry
    about that anymore.
  - Audioadapter will now follow the rate of the graph with
    the resampler adjusting itself dynamically.
  - Core now has a metadata implementation helper. A context
    will expose a metadata with settings that can be changed
    at runtime. This can be used to change the loglevel or
    graph quantum and samplerate on the fly.
  - An infinite loop was fixed in the audio converter.
  - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully. Handle truncated
    control data by dropping the client connection.
  - Fix profiler crash with many streams.
  - Improve latency handling in pw-filter. There is now a
    default handler and a ProcessLatency parameter to simplify
    latency reporting.
  - Latency reporting was improved in devices and streams.
  - And example sink/source was added.

## ALSA
  - hardware mute and volume are now properties on the
    Route param to make things easier.
  - More fixes for alsa-ucm 1.2.5.

## Tools
  - spa-json-dump now properly encodes string and keys.
  - pw-dump now shows the correct subject of the metadata.

    like pulseaudio.
  - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully.
  - Fix overflow of read/write pointers.
  - Source and sink state are now decoupled from the monitor
    state and will report IDLE when not playing anything.

## media-session
  - Port switching should now happen to/from the port that
    actually changed.

## JACK
  - The locking was reviewed. All callbacks are now emitted
    from the PipeWire thread with the lock released and
    the process function will be disabled for the duration
    of the callback. This ensures that no two callbacks are
    called at the same time.
  - Improve internal consistency and try to never call callbacks
    with invalid objects.
  - Monitor port can now be accessed with system:monitor_%d
  - client threads are now created with SCHED_FIFO and module-rt
    is used to create the other RT threads. This should avoid
    SIGKILL from RTKit in some cases.

## Bluetooth
  - Various bugfixes to improve connections to devices.
  - Handle delayed UUID connection.
  - There is now a hardware database that can disable features
    in listed devices.

PipeWire 0.3.24

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Many JACK midi improvements and device support.
  - Fixes in gnome-control-center default sink/source handling.
  - Many small performance improvements in alsa device handling
    and latency. There should also be less cracks/pops and xruns
    now.
  - Fixes for gnome-control-center default sink/source handling.
  - More bluetooth compatibility improvements.


- PipeWire improvements
  - Implement simple upmixing.

with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fixes for some critical bugs in last release.
  - Fix bug where audio was not drained properly at the end of
    playback, causing repeating sound.
  - Profile and route switching was improved and should mimic
    more what pulseaudio did.
  - Various fixes for xruns in capture and playback.
  - Bluetooth now supports delay adjustment and various other
    improvements.
  - The pulseaudio server now correctly identifies AC3 and DTS
    streams and returns a not supported error instead of playing
    static.

    the channel mixer. Channels should now play on the right
    speakers in all cases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Small fixes and improvements in JSON parsing and encoding.

    to, for example, control the resampler, mixer and latency.
  - Add sandboxing to the systemd services
  - Various FreeBSD fixes.
  - Improve draining and a way to exit the drain state as well.
  - Many multichannel fixes. Channel remapping should now be
    correct.
  - Fix bug with repeating audio at the end of playback because
    the drain in the resampler was not draining all channels.
  - RTKit default rt.prio has been increased to 88. This will
    likely still be clamped to 20 until distros increase the
    max priority.

- Session-manager
  - Don't try to switch to Pro Audio profile, this should be
    a user choice only.
  - Don't crash when metadata was disabled such as when not
    using the audio features of pipewire.
  - Rework the profile and route handling.
  - Add systemd unit files for the media-session
  - Device names should now also have sane names so that tab
    pactl completion works on them.

- Device support
  - Fix ALSA format enumeration in more cases. Use the channels
    and rate as a filter.
  - Make sure the graph doesn't ever use buffers larger than
    the alsa device buffer size or we get xruns.
  - Tuning of the alsa device timeout handling and dynamic
    resampler. There should now not be any xruns when streams
    appear and disappear or when the quantum changes.
  - Fix bug in alsa device when reassigning to a new driver,
    in some cases the dynamic resampler was not activated and
    things would drift out of sync and fail.
  - Fixes in quantum changes for ALSA capture and how the
    resampler is drained and fed with the new samples.

- Bluetooth
  - Delay adjustment has been implemented now. Bluetooth
    devices should now be more synchronized with video due
    to proper delay reporting. Because BT delays can be
    large, it can cause hickups in some players.
  - Fix volume in bluetooth devices.
  - Codec switch improvements.

- PulseAudio server
  - Latency offset adjustment is now implemented and functional
    for bluetooth devices. It is not working for alsa devices
    yet.
  - Handle unsupported formats. Previously we would accept encoded
    formats and play noise. This fixes AC3 playback in vlc.
  - Move some of the configurable parameters to the config file.
  - Fix a fatal use after free when playing samples
  - Improve module handling. loaded modules now show up in the
    list of modules and can be unloaded. This also prepares the
    core for more module implementations later.

- ALSA plugin
  - Fix drain with very large buffers, we need to manually start
    the stream before draining.
  - Fix the channel layout handling.
  - Improve compatibility with apps that expect the poll to only
    return when there is activity.
  - Fix drain for capture

- JACK
  - Add a config option to shorten and filter client names
  - Increase the length of the client name size and make sure
    we don't exceed the allocated size.
  - We now include our own jack header files so we can build
    without depending on another jack-devel package. We don't
    yet install the headers or provide pkgconfig files.


PipeWire 0.3.22

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Per client config files replace the module-profiles. It's
    now possible to tweak settings and load custom modules.
  - Pro Audio card profile support. You can now select the
    Pro Audio profile and have raw device access with the
    maximum number of channels and no mixer controls. This is
    the usual setup for managing high end Pro Audio cards.
  - Many fixes and improvements in the JACK library to make
    devices look and integrate better.
  - Many bluetooth improvements. Playback should be more
    reliable and better synchronized. Support for the HFP HF
    profile.
  - Small fixes and improvements all over the map.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Add support for restrictions requested by a client. This
    makes it possible to implement Flatpak policy for emulated
    PulseAudio clients as well.
  - Fix removal of params in objects. Previously they would not
    be removed from the cache.
  - Remove mlock warnings by default. There is an option to enable
    them again if you want to check if your system is optimized.
  - Remove LimitMEMLOCK lines from the service files. They can
    only lower the system settings and are thus not useful.
  - Implement per-client config files. Each pipewire client will
    now read a config file that you can use to configure the
    context of the client.
  - Implement state and config load/save in pipewire. This is used
    by the session manager or other apps.
  - Make an option to disable dbus support.

    when playing audio over bluetooth.
  - Fix stuttering in A2DP source
  - Tweak buffer size and latency settings to avoid stuttering
  - More work on HSP and HFP support
  - Fix initial profile configuration
  - Add HFP HF support

- PulseAudio server
  - Small tweaks in capture packet size to avoid crashes in some
    apps.
  - Detect Flatpak apps and requests the flatpak permissions from
    the session manager. This means that Flatpak pulseaudio apps
    will now run with reduced permissions.

- ALSA plugin
  - Reduce min buffer size in the plugin for lower possible
    latency.

- JACK
  - implement some missing methods to make qjackctl work again.
  - Use the context data thread instead of making our own. This
    fixes the issue where the data thread was not given RT
    priority correctly.
  - Pass extra jack flags around in port properties. This makes
    CV ports in carla work.
  - Many tweaks to the port names and aliases. Unwanted characters
    are filtered out, giving better names to jack apps. Default
    device names are now equal to those seen in pulseaudio apps.
  - Add an option to make a separate client for the monitor ports
    of a device. This makes it more usable in apps.
  - add support for system:playback_N and system:capture_N port
    names for apps that hardcode these port names.


PipeWire 0.3.21

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Many PulseAudio compatibility fixes. Handling of corked
    streams, the prebuf setting, seek modes and stream flags
    are now implemented correctly.
  - Ports and Profiles are now managed by the session manager
    and can save and restore previous settings.
  - ALSA device handling has been tweaked for maximum
    compatibility at the expense of latency. There are tuning
    options in the config file.
  - Improved Bluetooth support. HSP is disabled by default
    because it is old and deprecated and in some cases causes
    conflicts with the newer HFP profile. Codec switching is
    now implemented as well.
  - PipeWire accepts donations with liberapay now.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Improve draining in pw-stream.
  - pw-stream now uses busy metadata by default. This makes sure
    that no writer can write to buffers when readers are still
    busy.
  - Fix handling of empty array/choice instead of failing.
  - Fix crashes when creating properties from empty strings.
  - Make it possible to pass an array to module-access
    access.allowed variables
  - Fix small bug in argument parsing in pw-cat

- Session-manager
  - Restore route volumes in all cases, also when switching
    routes.
  - Use a default route volume for unknown routes instead of
    letting the system decide on a default.
  - Improve profile handling. Don't try to restore unavailable
    profiles. Implement the profile switching in the session
    manager now.
  - Fix handling of Virtual sources as defaults.
  - Handle port switching in the session manager. Implement
    save and restore of default ports per profile.

- GStreamer
  - Fix a crash with zero SPA_PARAM_BUFFERS_size

- Device support
  - v4l2-source will now respect the requested memory types.
  - ALSA buffering has been tweaked. USB devices should have
    less XRuns by default. Parameters can be tweaked to
    decrease the latency on capable devices. Also fix a case
    where a quantum change would cause an xrun.
  - Fix mute in bluetooth devices
  - bluetooth devices are not paused in idle anymore for
    improved compatibility.
  - Codec switching for bluetooth is implemented along with
    config options to select the codecs manually.
  - HSP for bluetooth is now disabled by default. Most devices
    support the newer HFP profile and some devices fail when
    both are available.
  - Reduce the amount of events the ALSA plugins emit by bundling
    them.

- PulseAudio server
  - Implement the suspend command
  - Fixes volume in sample info
  - Fix playback of samples, sometimes samples would be clipped
    short. Also implement the target sink for the sample.
  - Use rate match to feed samples. This way the latency can
    be kept to a minimum.
  - Latency has been tuned some more, more closely emulating
    pulseaudio behaviour.
  - Improve default sink/source handling. Make sure all events
    are sent correctly when defaults change.
  - Handle underrun better without causing sync issues. Make sure
    to pause in corked state.

with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Startup after login should be fixed now with inotify
    used to wait for permissions.
  - Channels should be mapped correctly now.
  - Many bluetooth improvements in LDAC, AptX-HD. AAC was

    cases.
  - Feedback loops were not scheduled correctly and would
    cause 100% CPU usage.
  - Small improvements to the profiler to also log incomplete
    graph status.
  - a new tool pw-top was added that prints real-time performance
    stats of the graph.
  - the rtkit module now sets the nice level to -11

- Session-manager
  - The session manager would sometimes link dont-reconnect
    nodes to another node, which would leak monitor streams in
    pipewire-pulse.
  - The session manager now has configuration files. Config files
    can also be placed in the user home directory to make custom
    configurations.
  - The session managers now creates unique device and node

PipeWire 0.3.18

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - More work in the PulseAudio server. It should be compatible
    with more applications.
  - Bluetooth now support extra codecs such as AptX/HD and LDAC.
  - Support for virtual sources and sink was improved a lot.
  - Added a new pw-dump tool to dump the objects in JSON formats
    and for filtering them with tools like jq.
  - Many more stability fixes and improvements.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Silence some harmless warnings
  - pw-cli can now be used to set parameters.
  - Streams now perform the correct channel mapping when linked
    to non-standard multichannel devices. Previously channels
    would get swapped.
  - port, node and device params are now cached in the server.
    This avoids opening and closing devices whenever some client
    enumerates formats, which improves performance a lot,
    especially in cases where opening a device is slow.
  - Add a command to keep a device open during negotiation. This
    is used to enumerate and set a format while opening the
    device just once, improving performance.
  - The null-sink scheduling was fixed.
  - A memory corruption bug was fixed in format conversion, this
    could cause crashes, silent channels or other undefined
    behaviour.
  - There is now a simple JSON parser.

- Session-manager
  - Settings files are now stored in JSON. With the json parser
    this is easier to parse and extend

- Device support
  - Bluetooth now supports additional codecs: LDAC, AptX and
    AptX HD. LDAC is known to not work very well yet.
  - ALSA devices will now default to the max supported channels
    if nothing else is specified. This makes it possible to use
    8+ channel cards with the alsa-pcm module, which is not
    supported with the default alsa-acp module.
  - Enable mSBC support in oFono.
  - Add an option to disable hardware mixers
  - ALSA now improves support for batch devices.
  - The udev rules had references to Pulseaudio removed in order
    to not create conflicts.
  - Fix a potential crash in bluetooth devices when
    disconnecting.
  - UCM cards now use HW volume when possible.

- PulseAudio server
  - The id can now be used as the name to locate cards and
    devices
  - Report streams with planar formats as well
  - Better error reporting when stream create fails
  - module-null-sink can now handle channels, rate and
    channel_map properties
  - Add support for 3 types of virtual devices: source,
    sink and duplex.
  - set-port was fixed
  - Some buffer parameters were tweaked to improve
    performance, compatibility and stuttering with lower
    latency.
  - NULL can be used as a name for the device sink/source
  - Support lookup of monitor names
  - Set properties more like pulseaudio so that some
    clients (Teamspeak) don't crash anymore

PipeWire 0.3.17

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix crasher bug for kwin when screensharing stopped.
  - Massive improvements and compatibility fixes in the
    PulseAudio server.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ It will look for files there
    to activate session manager modules. Packagers can use
    this to only activate the audio modules when the PulseAudio
    server, libjack.so or the alsa modules are installed.

- PipeWire improvements
  - We now clear hooks before adding them. Some application
    did not clear them and had random data for the destroy
    callback.
  - Return -ENOENT from unknown resources so apps can handle
    this better. It's a common problem when an app tries to
    introspect and object but it disappeared before the message
    reached the server. Apps should ignore this.
  - channelmap information is now passed with the volume
    settings.
  - DMABuf is not mmapp()ed anymore with the FLAG_MAP_BUFFERS in
    the stream or filter. This is because DMABuf usually
    requires more that just a simple mmap and is better left
    for the application.
  - increase the maximum number of ports for a client-node.
  - adapter and node-factory now support the linger option to
    keep the objects alive after the creating client disconnected.

- Device support
  - ALSA now handles error in close(), like when unplugging a
    USB device.

- Session-manager
  - The session manager is now handling DONT_RECONNECT streams
    without a target node. They get connected to a default node
    once and then fail to reconnect.
  - The session manager now exposes the stream setting as
    metadata. This makes it possible for other components, such
    as pulse-server to use this information. Information is stored
    as a json object for easier consumption.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ packagers can use this

- PulseAudio server
  - Pulse server now acquire the dbus name.
  - Improvements in timing and compatibility with many apps.
  - The stream-restore extension is now implemented so that
    the event volume can be configured.
  - Many stability fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some issues with module-load/unload


PipeWire 0.3.16

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix screensharing for old 0.2 clients
  - Many pulse-server improvements. There is now a
    pipewire-pulse binary that is the preferred solution for
    PulseAudio compatibility. The replacement libpulse
    libraries are now deprecated. This also makes audio in
    Flatpak work.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Fix cleanup of listeners everywhere. Force remove of
    listeners in _destroy to avoid crashes.
  - Add support for a journald logger module.
  - Various memory leak fixes
  - Silence some warnings that spammed the logs.
  - Fix flush in pw_stream. This fixes small glitches when
    switching streams in music players.
  - Various FreeBSD fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some crashes when destroying objects.

- Device support
  - Reload the ALSA configuration when creating a node so that
    hotplugged devices work in all cases.
  - Fix memory leaks in ACP library. This also fixes issues
    where the mixer device was not closed.
  - Bluetooth now has support for the mSBC codec for SCO
    source and sink.

- pulse-server
  - Many introspection and compatibility improvements. It should
    now be as good or better than the replacement library.
  - Implement sample cache to make notification events work.

- JACK layer
  - handle errors when linking, fixes jack_connect hang when
    the ports were already linked.


PipeWire 0.3.15

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This is a quick update to fix critical issues with the
    0.3.14 update, which broke screen sharing and accidentally
    enabled the experimental pulse-server.
  - Fix some compatibility issues in pulse-server with
    pavucontrol and fix an issue that would block the complete
    server.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Permission checks for new clients are now done from a
    global context, which makes it possible to assign initial
    permissions to objects.
  - Handle EINTR everywhere
  - Fix an issue with the node state changes where a quick
    pause/play would hang a client.

- Session manager improvements
  - Disable the bluez5 and pulse-bridge modules by default because
    they interfere with pulseaudio. These options should only be
    enabled if pulseaudio is removed or disabled in the system.
  - Fix an issue where the session manager could end up in
    infinite recursion while scanning for things to do.
  - The session manager will now always configure nodes to remix
    to the channel configuration of the device. This fixes the case
    where mono streams would only end up on one channel of a stereo
    device.

- Device support
  - Initial merge of A2DP extra codec support using the new bluez5
    API.

- pulse-server
  - Create the runtime directory when it doesn't exist.
  - Don't ever block the server, use non-blocking IO everywhere.
  - Fill description of profiles with the name if not otherwise set,
    this fixes a crash in pavucontrol.
  - the connection debug category will now also debug pulse
    messages.
  - Respect the no_remix flag to make the control panel channel
    check work.

- ALSA plugin
  - implement pause


PipeWire 0.3.14

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This release focuses on bugfixes and stability
    improvements.
  - A new experimental pulse-server module was added. This
    module implements the pulseaudio protocol on top of
    PipeWire and can be used to make flatpaks work with
    PipeWire. It looks like this might be a better way
    forward compared to the libpulse.so replacement library.
  - A2DP bluetooth was reworked. Playback should work a lot
    better now. Support was also added to automatically link
    an A2DP source to a playback device, which makes it possible
    to use PipeWire as a bluetooth receiver as well.
  - Improvements to the routing and volume restore features
    of the session manager.


- PipeWire improvements
  - The channelmixer does not normalize volumes anymore. Volumes
    are only normalized for monitoring streams now.
  - Streams can actually start in the inactive state now.
  - The channelmixer can now also convert volume updates from one
    channel layout to another. This makes saved volumes work
    even when streams have different channel layouts.
  - Clients are only registered after the properties have been
    updated.
  - Links now have a new active state.
  - Drivers can now also specify a minimum quantum. This makes it
    possible for bluetooth devices to specify an optimum quantum
    for the given codec settings and MTU.
  - The amount of data sent over the socket was reduced by only
    sending the data that changed.
  - Client objects are now exposed after they uploaded their
    properties, which makes the new object more useful.

- Tools improvements
  - pw-cat will now add metadata to the PipeWire streams.

- Session manager improvements
  - Fix crashes when reading bad data in stored settings.
  - volume and routing is improved. Settings are now remembered
    per application or media-role.
  - The session manager remembers the last device used per stream
  - Fix a bug when moving streams where it could sometimes end
    up with linking a stream to multiple devices.
  - Use RTKit to set realtime priority on the data thread in the
    session manager. This improves performance of the pulse-server
    and bluetooth devices.
  - Add a new property to mark streams that want to capture from
    the monitor of the default sink.
  - NODE_TARGET can now also contain the node name. This avoids
    some lookups in the pulseaudio layer when selecting target
    nodes by name.
  - the -e and -d options are more usable now and can be used to
    add and remove modules from the default list of modules.

- Device support
  - v4l2: add some workarounds for buggy drivers. Add Limited
    support for droidcam.
  - ACP: improve selection of default port and profiles.
  - ACP: add support for using the hardware mixer for more than
    8 channel streams.
  - ACP: support the new port type and availability group found
    in PulseAudio.
  - A2DP bluetooth timings were reworked. Automatic linking of
    A2DP sources was added to make it possible for PipeWire to
    act as a bluetooth receiver. The code was reworked to allow
    other codecs such as APTX and LDAC in the future.
  - Try harder to recover from ALSA errors.

- GStreamer improvements
  - Fix some crashes in the monitor that cause
    gnome-initial-setup to crash.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Many compatibility improvements. Improved playback in
    chrome. Fix a crash in firefox when the daemon is stopped.
  - Fix a leak in the formats.
  - Fix !ADJUST_LATENCY streams like paplay.
  - Make the device option in paplay work.
  - Fix volume/mute notifications, this makes plasma volume updates
    work again.
  - Do the conversion between PulseAudio cubic volumes and PipeWire
    linear volumes. Volume levels should behave now like they did
    with PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Return an error when we run out of midi events. Some application
    rely on this behaviour.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  - The ALSA plugin now also supports the node name in the
    playback_node and capture_node properties.


PipeWire 0.3.13

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Add pw-reserve tool to reserve or monitor a device on DBus.
  - Install spa-resample, a tool to resample a file.
  - Install spa-acp-tool, a tool to inspect the card profile.
  - Various fixes and improvements
  - Fix a bug in pw-stream where a capture stream could run out
    of buffers and become silent.
  - Rework the processing loops in the adapter and stream. There
    is now less latency in PulseAudio and ALSA layers.

- Session manager improvements
  - Improve the device reservation code. We now try to acquire
    the device using the dbus device reservation API before we
    probe the device. This avoids conflicts with a running
    PulseAudio where devices would disappear (because they were
    locked by the other process).
  - Don't fail on invalid input from the config files.
  - Audio devices now have the same name as what PulseAudio
    would assign.

- Device support
  - v4l2: try to use the format before enumerating the size and
    framerate. Some drivers don't check the format and might now
    work better.
  - v4l2: Fall back to MMAP when EXPBUF fails. Fix MMAP access,
    just export the fd and the mapoffset. This should make more
    devices work.
  - Fix crash in ALSA Card Profile (ACP) code.
  - ACP: fix selection of default profile. Prefer any possibly
    available profile over 'Off'. This makes some card at least
    start with something.
  - Fix soft volume. After setting the volume to 0, it would stay
    at 0 until pushed over the max volume. This should fix
    various volume related issues.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Rework the buffering and latency measurements and tweak the
    buffer attributes. This should make browsers and media
    players work better. This should also improve speechd
    performance.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Fix compilation against newer JACK.


PipeWire 0.3.12

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * the channelmap converter now handles unknown and strange
    channellayouts much better.
  * the resampler is now cleared correctly, avoiding clicks and
    pops at the start of sound.
  * Fixes for various crasher bugs. (paplay drain, vlc shutdown,
    pactl info, ...)
  * Fix a race condition in the node state changes that caused
    all kinds of sync and other issues (vlc, mpv, ...)
  * Improve the binary name property of applications
  * Fix the scheduling again of nodes that always need a driver
    such as the jack clients.

- Session manager improvements
  * fix routing to default nodes. Sometimes nodes were not routed to
    the default node (bluetooth)

- Device support
  * disable channelmap from ALSA by default. This is what PulseAudio
    does and thus provides better compatibility.
  * fix a bug in how the resampler was used in the ALSA source,
    causing distortion and errors when using low latency capture
    clients. (Discord, webrtc, ...)
  * Small bluetooth improvements. More work is needed for reliable
    bluetooth playback.

- GStreamer plugins
  * the device provider now stops the processing loop before shutting
    down, which avoids crashes (gnome-initial-setup).

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * the buffer attributes were reworked to ensure compatibility with
    many more applications such as mpv and audacious.
  * the pulseaudio layer will now try hard to not hand out invalid
    channel maps to the application. (avoids crashes in
    gnome-volume-control). The channel map will now also look more
    like what PulseAudio does.
  * the @DEFAULT_SINK/SOURCE/MONITOR@ wildcards now work. This
    fixes the problem with volume keys when they are bound to
    scripts using pactl and the default sink/source wildcards.
  * the PIPEWIRE_LATENCY environment variable now works again
  * Fix some leaks of ports and port info. Also fix the leak of the
    context when the mainloop is stopped.
  * The sink/source format_info array is now filled up completely,
    this is actually not implemented yet in the real PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  * jack now returns version 3.0.0 and has PipeWire in the version
    string so that apps can report this.


PipeWire 0.3.11

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * Properly cleanup the mixer structures when a port is removed,
    this should fix client crashes related to port config changes
    and other random crashes.
  * Optimize the preferred formats in the audio converter. Higher
    quality formats with higher performance are chosen first.
  * Make sure the time reported by pw_stream is always increasing,
    even when the driver and clock changes.
  * There is now also a system service and socket that can be used
    to enable PipeWire systemwide. This is however not recommended
    and disabled by default.
  * Fix channelmixer 5.1 to stereo mix matrix. It was not reading
    the conversion matrix correctly and cause channels to be
    dropped. The channelmixer will now also normalize the volume,
    like what pulseaudio does.
  * The channelmixer will now just copy channels when no layout
    has been given. It has also optimized paths for this. This
    makes it possible for apps to request > 8 channels from the
    alsa plugin (ardour).
  * Port, Node and Link will now also emit an error on the
    resources in addition to updating the error in the info. This
    would make it easier to track negotiation errors in the session
    manager later.
  * many small fixes and cleanups.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ DOSBox: fix crash because of double free in pw_stream

- Session manager improvements
  * The session manager will now try to configure the client to
    the channel configuration of the sink/source. It will only
    do this for downmixing, never for upmixing and also never
    when the client has the dont-remix property set. It will
    also renegotiate the channel layout when moving a stream to
    a new sink/source.
  * Configuration state is now saved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    Previously it was saved in $HOME/.pipewire-media-session/
    You can migrate the state by moving the files to
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire-media-session (or
    $HOME/.config/pipewire-media-session as a fallback when
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).

- Device support
  * Bluetooth sources and sinks should work better now.
  * There is now also a new bluetooth backend using hsphfpd.
  * fix the ALSA UCM Off profile for alsa pcm devices
  * improve ALSA port and profile switching. The ACP device will
    now switch to the best port and profile when availability
    changes.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * Implement some more callbacks. The pulse layer will now also
    notify applications of stream moved, started and latency
    changes.
  * Fix error code when an object was not found. We now return
    PA_ERR_NOENTITY instead of PA_ERR_INVALID.
  * Add some support for loading new null sinks. Applications such
    as pulseeffects use this. Note that pulseeffects does not yet
    work reliably but can start now.
  * Improve handling of profile and port updates, it should work
    much more reliable now. Apps should now also again receive
    volume updates from sinks/sources.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ openal-soft 1.20
	+ pavucontrol (checks PA_ERR_NOENTITY)

- JACK layer improvements
  * improve default source and sink handling. It was not updated
    correctly in all cases.
  * add samplerate and period to the pw-jack wrapper to easily
    configure the desired samplerate and period for the app.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  * Add a mixer entry in the alsa config file.
  * Implement support for planar types, rework the processing
    function to make it more robust.
  * refuse to load the alsa plugin when linked against 0.2. This
    catches some old apps linked against 0.2 that want to use the
    alsa plugin.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ linphone (ALSA SIGFPE when _status() is called
	  before _prepare()).

PipeWire 0.3.10

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Many improvements to the pulse layer.
  * GStreamer pulsesink element now works.
  * Fixes some segfaults.
  * Enable rtkit for client threads.
  * fixes capture of monitor stream by name
  * implement some more extensions, this makes paman
    work and removes some warnings.

- Many improvements to the GStreamer elements
  * negotiation rework, avoid calling GStreamer methods from
    the PipeWire callbacks because they might block and cause
    deadlocks.
  * Add support for non-string property values.
  * improve stability after buffer and format
    renegotiation.
  * Rework the device provider.
  * pipewiresink can now provide a stream that can
    be consumed by apps like cheese.

- Many improvements to the JACK layer:
  * Rework the buffer_size callbacks. Make sure we call
    the callback from a 'safe' thread and that we don't
    call the process callback while the application is
    handling the callback. This improves stability in
    apps like Carla when PipeWire dynamically changes
    the buffer size.
  * Improve compatibility with apps that call
    get_buffer_frames() with a 0 size (calfjackrack)
  * JACK can now create nodes that can be set as a
    sink/source in PulseAudio/ALSA apps (you can make an
    effects rack and set that as default sink for
    apps).

- Added a group id property for nodes. This makes it
  possible to schedule nodes with the same driver even
  when they are otherwise not linked together. To make
  this work well a new flag needed to be added to nodes
  to signal when they are ready for processing.

  Together with the GStreamer fixes, this makes things
  like:

   gst-launch-1.0 -v pipewiresrc path=51 stream-properties="props,node.group=1" !
         audio/x-raw ! pipewiresink stream-properties="props,node.group=1"

  work as expected with PipeWire managing the resampling
  to keep the clocks of the devices in sync.

  This can later also be used to force devices to be grouped
  together to create a JACK-like scheduling group.

- Streams and filter now use PIPEWIRE_NODE and
  PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variables as fallback.

- ACP add per device port list. This makes UCM devices
  expose the right ports.

- Fix some segfaults in ACP and UCM.

- make pw-cat use the metadata to find default devices.

- The media session can now save and load audio device
  Profiles and Routes (volumes), stream volumes and
  the default sink and sources.

PipeWire 0.3.9

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix bad audio in chrome

- Remove some errors that are not real errors.

- Fix 100% cpu when disconnecting devices.

- Improve pulseaudio introspection of formats

- Fix JACK metadata handling, carla can now monitor the
  port it creates and insert midi.

- Add a new permission bit (M) that is needed to be able
  to configure metadata on an object. Improve security of
  metadata some more, only allow metadata on objects that
  are visible to the client setting the metadata.

- Add support for videocrop in the GStreamer elements.

- Improve handling of the runtime directory for the
  server sockets. Add some reasonable fallback when
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set, as suggested in the spec.

- Improve ALSA device names from ACP.

- Fix various crasher bugs. One in the pulse layer, one in
  the session manager.

- Make alsa plugin respect the PIPEWIRE_REMOTE env variable.

- Various compile fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.8

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix an embarrassing crasher in the JACK layer when
  metadata keys were removed.

- Make it possible to add properties to jack clients with
  a PIPEWIRE_PROPS env variable. This can be used to make
  JACK nodes look like a device (like an effects rack).

- Improvements in the session manager in how it links
  ports. Now it will try to link matching channels first
  and be more intelligent otherwise. The session manager
  will also configure the stream to the device port
  configuration when needed.

- Add ofono backend for Bluetooth HeadSet support.

- Improve default source and sink handling. They are now
  stored with their id, instead of name, in the metadata.
  This makes it work better with JACK because of JACK's
  limited name length.

- Improve environment variables to make it possible to
  create and connect to servers other than "pipewire-0".
  Implement this in pulseaudio, JACK and alsa layers.

- Add an alsa mixer plugin so that alsamixer works with
  PipeWire. It will configure the default source/sink
  volumes.

- Fix capture devices. There was something wrong with how
  the resampler was used that caused corruption in the
  signal when the resampler was active.

- We now ship alsa card paths, profile-sets configuration
  files and udev rules so that we don't have to rely on
  the pulseaudio ones.

- Many build and stability fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.7

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
  code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
  all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
  mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
  be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
  in how it presents and manages devices.
  Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
  and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
  it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
  compatibility layer for those who want to try.

- Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
  pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
  the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
  screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
  still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
  elements can now also share a connection between them.

- Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
  and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
  fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.

- Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
  where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
  memory.

- Support for passive links is added again. These are links
  that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
  This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
  to suspend as a group when not in use.

- Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
  the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
  to how links and node states were handled. More work is
  needed to implement more use cases.

- Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
  was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
  in reuse of the wrong memory.

- Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.

- Improved error handling in the session manager.

- Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
  sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
  to the default device. Changing the default device will
  move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
  respect the default source/sinks.

- Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
  a stream and the session manager will move streams when
  the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
  implement the move_stream feature.

- Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
  has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
  apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
  objects. Security related properties are made read-only
  now. Different access modules can now coexist.

- The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
   1) a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
   2) a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.


PipeWire 0.3.6

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Extensive memory leak fixing and stress testing was done.
  A big leak in screen sharing with DMA-BUF was fixed.
- Compile fixes
- Stability improvements in jack and pulseaudio layers.
- Added the old portal module to make the Camera portal
  work again. This will be moved to the session manager in
  future versions.
- Improvements to the GStreamer source and sink shutdown.

  can use defaults in the first case and error in the second
  case.
- Fix cleanup of proxy objects. Stability improvements on
  plug/unplug in session manager.
- Make it possible to set log level from config file
- improve debug of param negotiation errors. Log the
  parameters to stderr/journal.
- Make it possible to configure global logger
  implementation.
- Fix NEON detection
- JACK and PulseAudio compatibility improvements


PipeWire 0.3.4

  extra internal queue. pipewiresink can now be used to
  play audio.
- Add pw-jack and pw-pulse scripts to run pulseaudio and
  jack applications with the right library path.


PipeWire 0.3.2

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- build fixes
- Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
  possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
  and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
  format.
- Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
- Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
  to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
  negotiate.
- Fix JACK midi output.
- Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
  AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
- Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
  shader.
- Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
  processing and use the values from the processing
  context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
- Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
  config file.
- Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
  cause the server to leak all buffers.
- Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
- Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
- Try to select higher quality formats first when
  negotiating a format with an audio device.
- Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
- Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
  do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
  pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
  default and has options to select a different server.
- Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
  samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.


PipeWire 0.3.1

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
  sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
  Only enable this for the jack library for now.
- Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
  signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
  the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
- Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
- improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
  warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
  started the operation or is the owner of the object.
- pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
  in verbose mode
- fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
- Fix and update some examples

  nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
- Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
  about a boolean.
- pulseaudio: improve compatibility


PipeWire 0.3.0

The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the development of
PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
layer with comparable performance to JACK2.

The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
development files and runtime paths are versioned so that
future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
existing applications.

PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
expected that future version will either switch to a more
flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
configuration options of the example session manager.

PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.

PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
to be somewhat problematic for now.
