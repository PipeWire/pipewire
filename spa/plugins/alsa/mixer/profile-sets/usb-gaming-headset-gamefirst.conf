; for general audio, and the second one is meant for chat. There is also
; a single input device for chat.
; The purpose of this unusual design is to provide separate volume
; controls for voice and other audio, which can be useful in gaming.
;
; Works with:
; JBL Quantum 810 Wireless
; JBL Quantum One
;
; Based on usb-gaming-headset.conf.
;
; See default.conf for an explanation on the directives used here.
