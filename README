PipeWire
--------

PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia
pipelines. This includes:

  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
       application provided streams) and multiplexing this with
       clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.

Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes,
communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd
passing.

Building
--------

Pipewire uses the Meson and Ninja build system to compile. If you're not
familiar with these tools, the included "autogen.sh" script will
automatically run the correct meson/ninja commands, and output a Makefile.
It follows that there are two methods to build Pipewire, however both rely
on Meson and Ninja to actually perform the compilation:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

or the Meson/Ninja native method:

$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja

You can see the available meson options in meson_options.txt file. All plugins are
disabled by default. To enable a spa plugin you need to enable spa-plugins and the
plugin name meson option.

$ meson build -Dspa-plugins=true -D<plugin-name>=true
